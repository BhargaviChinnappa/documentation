title : Call Details Report (CDR) of your voice agent on Insights module
sidebar_label : Auto-generated call details report 
---


:::note
In Data Explorer, CDR is available only for voice agents. The data will be updated after the call is completed. 
:::

This article focuses on **Call details report** (CDR) for voice agents, a database table maintained by yellow.ai platform which records more than 15+ important metrics (like start time, duration, recording url etc) for each call.


## 1. Call details report overview

CDR is a report of telephony data obtained from each call (voice agent conversation with customer) for reporting and analytics purposes. Parameters of every call made through the **yellow telephony system** is recorded in the CDR, making it a reliable source of truth for call-related information.

- CDR fields help businesses gain valuable insights into their call center operations and customer interactions.
- The CDR table contains several fields that record various details about the call, such as **call duration, caller ID, called number, call status, and call type**. CDR fields are explained in the [last section](#cdr) of this article. 
- By analyzing CDR data, businesses can **identify trends and patterns** in their call center operations, **improve call quality**, and **enhance customer experience**, make **data-driven decisions** and **optimize** the voice agent operations for maximum efficiency and effectiveness.

Examples of insights you can derive from the auto generated call details report: 
- Retrieve a list of users who disconnected calls during the last 7 days.
- Retrieve the answering rate for a specific campaign (identified by its ID) that was launched last Sunday.
- Retrieve daily total calls handled by the voice agent.

### Use case 3: voice agent billing analysis

VoIP/IVR providers aim to bill companies accurately for channel usage. Analyzing call durations is pivotal. Quick disconnects within 5 seconds may not yield valuable insights and can be excluded from billing. For durations between 15 to 30 seconds, one billing rate applies, while calls exceeding 30 seconds fall into a different billing band. The Call Details report provides actionable insights for such billing scenarios. Follow these steps:

1. Navigate to **Insights > Data Explorer > Call Details report**.
2. Click on **Filters** and select **Callduration**.
3. Click **+Add buckets > Varied** and create billing buckets by adding Values like `<=5s`, `15-30s`, and `>=30s`.

4. Apply these buckets to categorize call durations, enabling a clear view for billing decisions.

##  <a name="cdr"></a> 4. CDR fields and their definitions


The CDR report provides the following information:


### Call ID

Call ID, or Call Identifier, is a system-generated unique identifier that is used to track and identify a specific phone call. It is used to keep track of various aspects of the call, such as its duration, call status, and other relevant information. Each call on the Yellow platform is assigned a unique Call ID, which can be used to look up details about the call in the platform's logs or reporting tools. 

### Call start time 

Call start time refers to the timestamp, at which the call was initiated by the caller. This timestamp marks the beginning of the call and is used to track when the call was started.

### Call end time 

Call End Time refers to the time when a phone call or a communication session is terminated or disconnected.

### Ring Duration

Ring duration refers to the length of time that a phone rings before the call is either answered or goes to voicemail. It is the time between when an incoming call is received and when it stops ringing. Ring duration is typically measured in seconds.

### Call Duration

Call duration refers to the length of time that a phone call. It is the amount of time that starts from when the call is ringing, connected or answered and ends when the call is disconnected or ended. The call duration is important to measure for various reasons, such as billing purposes, quality assurance, and analysis of call traffic patterns.

### Voice Bot Duration

Voice agent duration, in seconds refers to the length of time that a voice agent or automated voice response system interacts with a caller during a phone call. This duration starts when the caller is first connected to the voice agent and ends when the call is transferred to a live agent or when the call is disconnected. The voice agent duration can vary depending on the complexity of the voice agent's responses and the options provided to the caller.

### Voice Bot Bill Duration

The duration, in seconds, of the conversation between the user and the voice agent, rounded up to the nearest Voice Billing Pulse interval for billing purposes.

### Campaign ID

A Campaign ID is a system-generated unique identifier assigned to a marketing campaign to track its performance and measure the effectiveness of marketing efforts. This field is empty for inbound calls by default.

### Hangup Reason

Hangup Reason refers to the reason why a call or communication session was terminated, ended, or disconnected. The possible values are **TTS failure, STT failure or Network faliure** (you may also find similar values with these descriptions: Normal Hangup, Bot failure, Bot response invalid, Bot response failure, DTMF over parent call, Message loop detected, Missed Consecutive DynamicNode Packets, Media download failure, STT resource not available, TTS resource not available, Network error, Invalid Destination, Phone Unreachable/Switch Off, Ring timeout, User Busy, Inbound Blocked)
Hangup Reason is a valuable metric for analyzing call center performance and identifying areas for improvement. By tracking and analyzing the reasons for call terminations, call centers can identify common issues, patterns, and trends, and take steps to address them to improve customer satisfaction and retention.


### Hangup Source/ Disconnected by 

Hangup source/Disconnected by specifies the party that disconnected the calls. The possible values for this column are **User/Bot/System**.
- USER: When the customer itself disconnects the call.
- BOT: When the voice agent disconnects the call after providing the necessary information.
- SYSTEM: When neither voice agent nor the user disconnects the call and the call is disconnected due to any of the system issues. 


Hangup Source can provide useful information for analyzing call quality, identifying problems with the network or equipment, and understanding the reasons for call failures.

### Source Number

Source number refers to the phone number or caller ID of the party that initiated the call. It is the number from which the call originated. In other words, it is the phone number of the person or device that made the call.

### Destination Number

The destination number refers to the phone number that received the call or message. It is the phone number dialed by the caller or the recipient of an inbound call.

### Call Status

The call status field refers to the final status of a call when it ended or was terminated. This field indicates whether the call was successful or not and can provide more details about the reason for call termination. Some common call status codes are **Answered, Not Answered, Failed, or Not Valid**. 

### Direction

Specifies the direction of the call, either Inbound or Outbound. It could be **inbound**, meaning the call was received from an external source, or **outbound**, meaning the call was initiated by the user from the system.

### Recording URL

An URL to the end-to-end call recording of the call, which is usually recorded by default. Users have the option to pause recording during certain sections of the call or stop recording altogether as part of the voice agent logic.
The recording URL can be used to retrieve and listen to the recording of the call.

### SIP Code 

For each call, an error code (SIP code) is generated to understand the hang up reason.
