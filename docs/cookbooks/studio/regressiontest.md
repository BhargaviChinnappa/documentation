---

Instead of manually training and testing intents, utterances, and FAQs, you can auto-generate and test them in bulk. This automation allows you to quickly train the AI-agent on all changes at once, saving time and reducing errors.

The platform will then run a prediction test and display results based on the confidence level. If the confidence level is low, the result will be displayed as a fail.

This guide will walk you through the process of testing intents, FAQs, and utterances in bulk via import.

### Test intents

You can upload all intents along with their associated utterances to your AI-agent and test them collectively. With a single click, you can train the AI-agent on all the changes at once. Based on the imported entities, the platform will then run a prediction test and display results based on the confidence level.

To test the intents, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Automation** > **Test**.

* You will see the following options. Choose your preferred options to test your AI-agent:
  * [Import Intents](#import-intents)
  * [Upload Utterances](#upload-utterances)

## Test KB

You can add a list of FAQs and upload it to generate answers based on the document uploaded in the KB section. Note that duplicate questions cannot be created and the answers will not be generated for them.

#### Limitations of KB bulk testing

When performing KB bulk testing, you need to consider the below limitations to prevent bulk tests from exceeding token or request limits and to ensure optimal performance for live bot traffic:

* **Bulk test limit**: You can only run 3 bulk tests per day.
* **Query limit per report**: Each bulk test report can include a maximum of 500 queries.

:::note
If you need to run a bulk test with a larger dataset, contact [customer success team](mailto:customersuccess@yellow.ai) with the relevant details for further evaluation.

To upload KB FAQs, follow these steps:

1. Choose Sandbox/Development environment.

2. Go to **Knowledge base**.
