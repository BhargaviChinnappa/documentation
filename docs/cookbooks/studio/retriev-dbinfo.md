1. [Insert a Database node](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/action-nodes-overview/database-node) in your flow.
2. In the Database node, set the **Select type** as **Search**, select the table that contains the details and set the filter based on which the search action should be performed.

3. Click the **Select Variable** option at the bottom right corner and create a new variable. All the information in your database will now be stored in this variable. Use this code snippet `**{{{variables.dbResponse.records.0.fieldName}}}**` in your flows to retrieve a specific set of data.
