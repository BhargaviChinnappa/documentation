-------------------

## 1. Prebuilt use cases

The following are the most common use cases (flows) that are prebuilt in this template:

1. **Start**: After providing a brief introduction about the bank and its offerings, this flow provides options to bot users on WhatsApp and the web to Create an account, Apply for a loan, View the Loan Status, Calculate EMI or Connect to support for better resolution. 
2. **Create new account**: This flow assists with creating a new savings or current account for the bank customer. It collects customer details like bank account type, name, email ID, phone number, PAN, and Aadhar number. Once the PAN and aadhar numbers are verified, a new account is created. 
3. **Apply for Loan**: This flow provides loan options like Car loans, Home loans, and Education loans. It collects the loan requirements such as type of loan, phone number, name, Aadhar card, PAN number, and request loan amount. Aadhar and PAN numbers are verified, and on successful completion,  an application is generated. 
4. **Loan status**: This flow displays the loan status of the existing loan application(approved, rejected, or other comments) for the entered phone number. 
5. **EMI calculator**: This flow calculates the EMIs applicable for the loan amount. It collects the loan amount, rate of interest, and loan tenure. Based on the given details, EMI is calculated.  
6. **Connect with support**: This flow provides customer support either by fetching answers from the trained FAQs or by connecting the bot user directly to the support agent to address complex queries.

These flows are explained in detail in the further sections.



:::note
A flow triggers when a particular intent/entity/event/URL is identified or when the [Execute flow](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/action-nodes-overview/execute-flow) node is used in other flows. See [start trigger](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/Flows/configureflow#configure-start-trigger) for more details.

### 1. Start - Display the main menu 

1. **Start trigger**: Immediately after displaying the welcome message, **Start** flow is triggered. 
    - It can also be triggered at any point of the conversation when the bot user types a sentence that matches with the [intent](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/train/intents)- ```Main menu options```. 
2. **Identify the channel**: A logic node ([channel filter](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/logic-nodes#2-channel-filter) is used to identify the channel in which the bot conversation is happening. Nodes used in the further flow will be based on the channel.
3. **Quick reply buttons to display menu options**: Five menu options (**Create an account, Apply for loan, Loan Status, Calculate EMI, and Connect with support**) are displayed. For WhatsApp, these are shown as Quick reply buttons using the [WhatsApp list](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/prompt-nodes#22-whatsapp-list) node, and for other channels, these are shown as menu options using the [Quick reply](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/prompt-nodes#14-quick-replies) node.

### 1.4 Loan status

1. **Start trigger**: This flow is triggered when the bot user selects the **Loan status** button from the menu options (start flow). 
    - It can also be triggered at any point of the conversation when the bot user types a sentence that matches with the [intent](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/train/intents)- ```Status of my loan```. 
2. **Fetch registered phone numbered**: Using the [phone node](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/prompt-nodes#13-phone) the registered phone number is obtained and stored in the ```customerPhone``` variable. 

> There must be an existing loan application to check its status. 

3. **Search for the application status from the database table**: ```Loan application``` [table](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/database) is created with required columns to store all the loan application details and their statuses. Using a [Database node](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/action-nodes-overview/database-node) in the flow, the application details of the entered phone number are fetched. 

> **Database node**: The response obtained from this node is a result of the **Search** operation performed on the table **Loan application** where the **Phone number** (table's column) matches the ```customerPhone``` (phone number variable entered by the bot user). This response is stored in a variable ```dbresp```. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/xxrTA8c.png)

4. **Display loan status**: Response obtained from the database consists of the status, which is stored in the ```dbresp``` variable. It is displayed using a [Text node](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/message-nodes1/message-nodes) and a variable: ``` {{{variables.dbresp.records.0.status}}}```
    - If the phone number entered by the customer does not exist (in the ```Loan application``` database), a message - "Application was not found, the application number does not exist." is displayed using a [Text node](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/message-nodes1/message-nodes).

![](https://i.imgur.com/cZE0FwK.png)


#### :pushpin: Tips 

- If the loan application does not exist, you can direct the users to apply for a loan. 
- This template can be customized to prompt the customer to apply for a loan and display other banking options (like applying for a credit card, EMI, etc.). 


-----------

### 1.5 EMI calculator 

1. **Start trigger**: This flow is triggered when the bot user selects the **Calculate EMI** button from the menu options (start flow). 
    - It can also be triggered at any point of the conversation when the bot user types a sentence that matches with the [intent](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/train/intents)- ```Calculate loan EMI```. 
2. **Fetch Amount, Interest, and Tenure**: [Question nodes](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/prompt-nodes#11-question) are used to obtain loan amount, specified interest rate, and loan tenure in months, these values are stored in three variables (```selectedLoanAmount```, ```selectedIr``` and ```selectedTenure```)
3. **Calculate and display EMI amount**: A function node is used to calculate EMI with the data obtained through question nodes. With help of a [Text node](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/message-nodes1/message-nodes) expected EMI is displayed. 
``` 
EMI = P × r × (1 + r)n/((1 + r)n - 1) 
(P= Loan amount, r= interest rate, n=tenure in number of months)
```

![](https://i.imgur.com/qHw4bbD.png)

#### :pushpin: Tips 

- This flow can be cloned and math operations can be used to modify the EMI function to calculate interest obtained on a savings account, current account, fixed deposit, recurrent deposit, etc. 

----------


### 1.6 Connect with support

1. **Start trigger**: This flow is triggered when the user selects **Connect with support** quick action from the start menu. This flow can also be triggered when the bot user's input matches with any of the sentences(utterances) trained for the ```chatWithAgent``` [intent](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/train/intents).
2. **Display and verify support options (Agent/FAQs)**: With a [carousel](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/prompt-nodes#16-carousel) node, two options (Chat with support and FAQs) are displayed. The type of support selected is identified using [condition node](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/logic-nodes#1-condition). ```@queries_and_concerns``` entity is trained to identify FAQs and Chat with support as ```entity values```.  
    - If the FAQs option is selected, answers to the user queries will be fetched from the trained FAQs. 
    - If Chat with support is selected, a support agent will be connected to take the conversation forward. 
3. **FAQs**: All the FAQs are added and trained with the answers in the [FAQs section](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/train/add-faqs). When FAQs is selected, a condition node ([channel filter](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/logic-nodes#2-channel-filter) is added to identify the channel from which the conversation is taking place. 
    - If the conversation is happening on WhatsApp, [WhatsApp list](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/prompt-nodes#22-whatsapp-list) node is used to display the list of FAQs.
    - If the conversation is via other channels, [Quick reply](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/prompt-nodes#14-quick-replies) node is used to display the list of FAQs. 
    -  User can also type the query in the input bar.
    -  Based on the selection/entry, the answer will be fetched from the trained FAQs. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/N3XaYml.png)


4. **Chat with support**: [Prompt nodes](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/prompt-nodes) are used to fetch the bot user's information such as ```phone number```, ```name```, and ```query```. These details are stored in the [respective variables](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/bot-variables#31-create-a-variable-via-nodes) and passed into the [Raise ticket](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/action-nodes-overview/raise-ticket) action node, this will connect the user to the support agent.  

> Inbox must be set up to connect the bot user to a live support agent. A support agent must be available (online) when the support request is raised. Click [here](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/inbox) to learn about Inbox. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/FEn6CQz.png)



#### :pushpin: Tips 

- Add/ Delete the number of FAQs listed on the Quick reply node. 
- Add [FAQs](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/train/add-faqs) based on your industry. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/GAmjyQ7.png)

- **Name** and **Query** are the mandatory fields to use a **Raise ticket** node. You can reduce the prompt nodes to avoid collecting details from the users prior or you can add more prompt nodes to collect other details before connecting to the agent.
- As per bank requirements, you can fetch user details (name, email address, number) using **Prompt** nodes even if the user selects FAQs. This data can be used later for acquisition or monitoring purposes.
