The E-commerce template offers a highly efficient and valuable service for online businesses. It guides your customers through buying products. This includes adding a product to the cart, updating product quantity, adding more products, and proceeding to purchase. Post-purchase, customers can track their order status. The template can handle common customer queries and helps connect with the support team if required.

You can use our platform to build custom flows for your business use cases. For example, promote products, show store location, showcase products from your database, enable single sign-on from your e-commerce site, and more.

Here is the high-level overview of the e-commerce template:

## 2. Build your own flows


* **Promote products**: Use the bot as a lead-generation tool. You can send offers, promote new products, and offer instant discounts to your leads through Outbound/Workflow campaigns.

* **Show store location**: If you are running both offline businesses, you can allow your users to find the nearest store location and address using location or zip code. Use **Database** to store all your locations or make use of APIs to fetch directly from external systems.

* **Showcase products from your database**: Use [APIs](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/api/add-api) and [Functions](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/code#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback) to access data from an external database directly. You can update order/user details, retrieve details, or show any other information that you want your users to access.

* **Enable single sign-on**: Make use of the [API](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/api/add-api) or [Database](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/database) modules and pass a custom script that can read data from your e-commerce site and pass it to the bot  every time the user opens the bot.
