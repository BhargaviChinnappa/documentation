## 1. Prebuilt cases

The following are the most common use cases (flows) that are prebuilt in healthcare template:

1. **Start:** This flow offers the options for a new patient to register, book a consultation, view clinics closer to their place, collect medical reports and reach out to support for personalised queries.
2. **New patient registration:** This flow collects the details of a new patient, for example, name, age, contact number, gender, email address and stores it in a database.
3. **Book a consultation:** This flow assists your users in scheduling an appointment with your healthcare centre by collecting the date and time of the doctor you would like to consult.Â 
4. **Locate nearby clinics:** This flow collects the user's location details and shows the clinics closer to their place.
5. **Collect report:** This flow helps your users collect their health reports by accessing their electronic records.
6. **Connect with support:** This flow provides customer support either by answering user questions from the trained FAQs or by connecting the bot user to the support agent to address complex queries.

-------------------

### 1.1 Start - Display the main menu

1. **Start trigger**: It is triggered immediately after the welcome message. 
    - It can also be triggered at any point of the conversation when the bot user types a sentence that matches with the [intent](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/train/intents) - ```Main menu options```. 
2. **Identify the channel**: A logic node ([channel filter](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/logic-nodes#2-channel-filter)) is used to identify the channel in which the bot conversation is happening. Nodes used in the further flow will be based on the channel.
3. **Quick reply buttons to display menu options**: Six menu options (**New Registration, Book a consultation, Locate nearby clinics, Collect reports, and Connect with support**) are displayed. For WhatsApp, these are shown as Quick reply buttons using the [WhatsApp list](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/prompt-nodes#22-whatsapp-list) node, and for other channels, these are shown as menu options using the [Quick reply](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/prompt-nodes#14-quick-replies) node.

#### :pushpin: Tips 

- You can add multiple [channels](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/channelConfiguration/overview) to your bot to reach out to your users through any mode.
- If you have varied menu options, you can add (or delete) the quick reply buttons and customize what can be displayed in the main menu.

-------------------

### 1.2 New patient registration

1. **Start trigger:** This flow is triggered when the bot user selects the **New patient registration** button when menu options are displayed (start flow).
It can also be triggered at any point of the conversation when the bot user types a sentence that matches the intent - ```New patient registration```.
2. **Fetch name, age, gender, email ID, and phone number**: Using prompt nodes - [name](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/prompt-nodes#12-name), [question](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/prompt-nodes#11-question), [email](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/prompt-nodes#15-email), [phone number](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/prompt-nodes#13-phone), and [gender](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/prompt-nodes#14-quick-replies) are fetched and stored in the respective variables - ```name, selectedAge, selectedGender, phoneNo, email```.

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/fcnNIEf.png)

1. **Start Trigger:** This flow is triggered when the bot user selects the **Locate nearby clinics** button when menu options are displayed (start flow).

   - It can also be triggered at any point of the conversation when the bot user types a sentence that matches with the [intent](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/train/intents) - ```Locate nearby clinics```
2. **Collect location:** User location is collected using the [location](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/prompt-nodes#24-location) node. This information is stored in a variable named **location**.
3. **Nearby clinics:** A search happens in the [database node](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/action-nodes-overview/database-node) that contains the location details of all the clinics. A flash message 'Please wait while we fetch the nearest branch.' is displayed using the [text](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/message-nodes1/message-nodes) node before showning nearby clinics.

   - If there is a clinic closer to the user location, the flow moves to the **success** branch.
   - If there's no clinic in or closer to the user location, the flow moves to the **fallback** and conveys this in a [text node](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/message-nodes1/message-nodes).

    ![](https://i.imgur.com/r2tHPOX.png)
4. **Clinic details:** The success branch is connected to a [function node](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/action-nodes-overview/function-node) which executes the function **nearbyClinics** and stores the clinic details in the variable **fiveNearbyDealers**.
5. **Display the clinic details:** The [function node](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/action-nodes-overview/function-node) is then connected to a [variable node](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/action-nodes-overview/variables-node) which is connected to a [condition node](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/logic-nodes#1-condition) and [text node](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/message-nodes1/message-nodes). At this step, the list of clinics will be displayed to the end user.

    ![](https://i.imgur.com/DPaxpMM.png)
3. **Identify the selected option and display details to collect report:** The selected option from the Carousel node is identified by the [condition node](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/logic-nodes#1-condition).
   - If MRN option is selected, [question](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/prompt-nodes#11-question) node is used to obtain the MRN number.
   - [Database](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/action-nodes-overview/database-node) node is used to fetch MRN.
   - [Function](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/code) - ```generateDynamicLink``` function is used to fetch the report from the ```record health``` database, which is stored in a [variable](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/bot-variables)- ```test_report``` and it converts the report into PDF format.
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/P6PVLqp.png) 
    - Similarly, if phone number option is selected, [phone number](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/prompt-nodes#13-phone) node is used to get the phone number of the patient.
	- [Database](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/action-nodes-overview/database-node) node is used to fetch phone number.

### 1.6 Connect with support

[Prompt nodes](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/prompt-nodes) are used to fetch the bot user's information such as ```phone number```, ```name```, and ```query```. These details are stored in the [respective variables](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/bot-variables#31-create-a-variable-via-nodes) and passed into the [Raise ticket](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/action-nodes-overview/raise-ticket) action node, this will connect the user to the support agent.  

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/7yl13Mx.png)

> Inbox must be set up to connect the bot user to a live support agent. A support agent must be available (online) when the support request is raised. Click [here](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/inbox) to learn about Inbox. 

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/9nZR7wo.png)



#### :pushpin: Tips 

- Add/ Delete the number of FAQs listed on the Quick reply node. 
- Add [FAQs](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/train/add-faqs) based on your industry. 

    ![](https://i.imgur.com/GAmjyQ7.png)

- **Name** and **Query** are the mandatory fields to use a **Raise ticket** node. You can reduce the prompt nodes to avoid collecting details from the users prior or you can add more prompt nodes to collect other details before connecting to the agent.
- As per requirements, you can fetch user details (name, email address, number) using **Prompt** nodes even if the user selects FAQs. This data can be used later for acquisition or monitoring purposes.
