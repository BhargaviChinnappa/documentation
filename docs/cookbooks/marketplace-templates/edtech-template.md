> * Customize the course names as required. You can add more items or remove existing items as needed.
    

3.  **Validates user input**: Uses the **Condition node** to validate the user selection. If-else logic is applied to trigger the *Maths main menu*, *Science main menu, and History main menu* flows based on the user input. 
    

:::note

History, Maths and Science main menus follow the same structure.

:::

4.  **Shows the carousel image with relevant options**: *Overview*, *Fee structure*, and *Apply now* options using the **Carousel** node and triggers a specific flow based on the user input.

### 2.2 Course material

You can show the course material in a file that the user can download to the users who registered for the course.

Let’s see the **Course material** flow in detail:

1.  **Starts** with the intent `Show me the course material`.
    
2.  **Captures user identifier**: Shows a text message followed by the **Phone Prompt **node and stores it in the `PhoneNo` variable.
    

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/oyp3CUl.png)

> * You can use email or other prompt nodes to identify the user.
    

3.  **Verifies if the identifier is registered**: Searches if the specified phone number is registered in the leads table (Database node) and stores the registered user details in the user_validation object variable.
    

Leads is a table created inside the **Database** module that contains these fields - Name, phone number, email address, course, subscription status (Demo, Active, or Inactive), record inserted date, and record updated date.

> * You can add new columns or remove an existing column according to your requirement.
> * Use APIs to send and receive information from third-party systems.
    

4.  **Allows registering new users**: If the user is not registered, it shows the Register now option, along with the Main menu and Try  again options (Quick replies node).  
    
    a. Selecting Register now executes the flow [Book a demo class](#23-book-a-demo-class) and updates the leads database.
   b. Selecting the Main menu triggers the **Start flow**.

5.  Shows the file for registered users: If the user is registered, it shows the list of courses available (Carousel node), and based on the user input (Condition node) it shows the relevant course material (File node) that the user can download (PDF file).
    

> * Customize the list of courses that you offer and upload the respective course materials.  
> * You can use Document to upload course materials and take advantage of Q&A where the system can extract most relevant answers from the uploaded documents automatically.
    
  

### 2.3 Book a demo class

This is a lead generation flow where users can book for a demo class. Post the demo class, you can provide an option to register for the complete course.

Let’s see the **Book a demo class** flow in detail:

1.  **Starts** with the intent `Book a demo class`.
2.  **Captures user information**: Shows a **Text** node followed by Name, Phone number, and Email nodes and stores the user’s response in the respective variables.

> * Modify the text that you want to show up when the flow starts.
> * Capture more details if required using the relevant nodes. You can skip any prompt (name, phone number, or email) if not required for your use case.
    

4.  **Validates user information**: Shows the details provided by the user. The user can verify the details provided and modify if required information using *Edit name, Edit email, Edit phone number*, and *No changes* (**Quick replies node**).  


   * This flow is to allow users to verify if the details provided are correct. Any changes the user makes through the respective edit options will update the values in the database accordingly.
    

5.  **Displays list of courses**: Selecting the *No changes* option sets the variable value for subscription as Demo and shows the list of courses (**Quick replies**).
6.  **Displays slots**: Shows the slots available for the selected course using the **Condition** node.

### 2.4 Connect with support

You can allow your users to connect to an education counselor to address their queries.

Let’s see the **Connect to a counselor** flow in detail:

1.  Triggers the Connect with support agent intent and shows two options - Chat with support and FAQs.  

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/kfPe4Lz.png)
    
2.  Here is how the Chat with support flow works:
    
   a.  **Collects user information**: Asks for the user’s name, mobile number, and email address using the respective **Prompt nodes**.
> * You can customize the information that you want to capture.
    
   b. **Asks for reason**: Shows a predefined list of  reasons before connecting to the support - **Cancel Membership**, **Get career related advice**, **Talk to support specialist**.
    

   c.  If the user selects *Cancel membership*, it triggers the **Cancel Membership** flow where it captures the reason for cancellation and updates the subscription status in the **Database**.
    
   d.  **Connects to the support**: If the user selects *Get career related advice*, or *Talk to support specialist*, it [connects to the live agent](#24-connect-with-support).
    
   e.  If the agent is offline, a new ticket is created.
    

3.  **FAQs flow**: It fetches answers quickly from the list of FAQs added through the [FAQs module](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/train/add-faqs).
    

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/w718G8Y.png)

   a.  Shows a list of frequently asked questions the user can select (**Quick replies node**).
    
   b.  Fetches replies based on the selected question.
    

  

> * You can keep the questions open-ended if required. Import FAQs in bulk using the [FAQs module](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/train/add-faqs#2-add-faqs-in-bulk) and the bot shows up the answer based on the keywords. You can then connect if he still wishes to contact support.
    

### 2.5 Take a quiz

You can allow the user to select the course that he is interested in, and show questions related to the course. Recommend the course levels according to their current knowledge. For example, recommend the basic course for answering basic questions incorrectly, recommend a basic course, if they answer basic questions correctly, recommend an advanced training course.

Let’s see the **Take a quiz** flow in detail:

![](https://i.imgur.com/5pSnBWy.png)

1.  Starts with Take a quiz intent.
2.  **Shows the list of courses**: Shows a text message followed by the list of courses to select from (Quick replies node).
3.  **Displays question**: Shows the relevant question with multiple answers (Quick replies node) for the selected course.
4.  **Recommends course level**: Recommends the course level based on the answer and provides discount codes (Text node).
5.  Provides options *Retake quiz* (if user selects incorrect answer) and *Book a demo* using Quick replies.
6.  Selecting *Book a demo* triggers [Book a demo class](#23-book-a-demo-class) flow and *Retake quiz* goes back to step 3.
    

## 3. Build your own use cases

Along with the prebuilt flows, you can create your own flows for your business specific use cases using [Studio](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/overview) and other modules of Yellow.ai.

Here are some EdTech specific templates:

-   **OTP verification for qualifying leads**: You can validate your registered user details through OTP based authentication using the Send OTP and Verify OTP action nodes.

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/lEyZPjC.png)

-   **Send campaigns to promote new courses**: Use the bot as a good lead generation tool. You can send course information, promote new courses, or offer discounts on existing courses to your leads through [Outbound campaign](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/outbound/outbound-campaigns/run-campaign) or [Workflow campaigns](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/flows_campaign).
    
-   **Take feedback/review on courses**: 
    You can create a flow to capture feedback from users. Provide an option to select the course, and list down the feedback options to select with a text box. Create a database table to store the user response.
    
-   **Single sign-on**: Make use of the API or Database modules and pass a custom script that can read data from your website and pass it to the bot directly every time the user opens the bot.
    
-   **Provide more study material**: You can use [Documents](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/train/what-is-document-cognition) feature available in Studio to upload your documents and generate FAQs from them. 
   For example, it can open the document and navigate to the specific page and section that the user has searched for.
    
-   **Take elaborate career quizzes**: You can increase the number of questions and complexity in a quiz. You can do assessment post completing the courses.
    
* **Use APIs to send or receive data**: You can also use [APIs](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/api/add-api) to send or receive data according to your preference from third-party systems. With the API feature, you need not sync or import the entire data to yellow.ai platform.
