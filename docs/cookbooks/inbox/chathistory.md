## Use Case 

The **View Recent Activity** feature in the Yellow.ai Inbox Module enables agents to review the historical support interactions—both email tickets and live chats—associated with a specific customer. This feature displays previously raised tickets along with key metadata such as agent name, ticket priority, and current status. Accessing this information allows agents to better understand recurring issues and provide more accurate and contextual support.

### 5. Repeat for Live Chats (if applicable)

- The same procedure can be used for reviewing live chat history.
- Navigate to **Inbox → Chats**, select a customer interaction, and follow the steps above to access their chat history via **View Recent Activity**.

## Expected Outcome

Agents can view a customer's entire ticket or chat history, improving their ability to respond to ongoing or recurring issues. By accessing past support interactions, agents are better equipped to provide efficient, context-aware resolutions.
The "View Recent Activity" feature is a critical tool for maintaining continuity in customer support and enabling proactive issue resolution.
