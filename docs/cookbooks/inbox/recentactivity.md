### 3. Reviewing Recent User Properties

- Upon clicking **View Recent Activity**, a panel will display the user's recent activity.
- Only **user property variables**—i.e., data points explicitly stored using variables during the bot flow—will be shown here.
- These include details that were collected during earlier conversations and can be used to understand user intent and behavior at the time a ticket was raised.

### 4. Viewing Full Activity Log

- If additional information is needed, scroll down to find the **"View All Activity"** option.
- Click on this option to be redirected to the **User 360 - User Profile Page**.

### 5. Using the User 360 - User Profile Page

- This section provides a comprehensive view of all user-related data and activities.
- Agents can:
  - View all property changes and ticket-related activities.
  - Add relevant **tags** to enhance the user profile and improve future context handling.
  - Use the built-in **search functionality** to quickly locate specific user properties.

### 6. Managing User Data

- To manage or remove user records, click on the **"Delete User"** button located at the top-right corner of the User 360 page.
- This action will delete the selected user and all associated activity data from the platform.

## Expected Outcome

Agents can efficiently trace a user’s journey, understand ticket contexts, and access relevant data points to facilitate better responses and decision-making. The feature also supports user data enrichment and cleanup via tagging and deletion options.

This feature streamlines agent workflows by centralizing user data, enabling faster resolution times and improved customer experience.
