AI agents are smarter and more flexible than old rule-based bots. Instead of following fixed scripts, they can understand context, make decisions, and act on their own. To build an effective AI agent, you need clear goals, the right setup, and ongoing improvements.

## Key Practices

### 1. Set the Purpose and Persona
Decide what role the agent will play.  
- Define its **tone and style** (helpful, professional, friendly, etc.).  
- Match the agent’s role to your business need (support expert, sales guide, knowledge assistant).  
- Link the purpose to a clear outcome, like faster service or fewer escalations.  

### 2. Focus on Use Cases, Not Scripts
Forget designing step-by-step flows.  
- Think in terms of **goals**: “Answer billing questions,” “Suggest the right plan,” “Book a meeting.”  
- The agent will build conversations around these goals using AI.  

### 3. Provide Knowledge and Context
Give the agent access to the right information.  
- Connect to your **knowledge base** for FAQs and guides.  
- Link to business systems (CRM, ERP, HR, ticketing) so it can complete tasks.  
- Add **rules, triggers, and variables** to keep conversations accurate.  

### 4. Add Guardrails
AI agents should work freely but with limits.  
- Set **handover to humans** for complex cases.  
- Use **fallbacks and validations** to avoid errors.  
- Monitor with tools to understand how the agent makes decisions.  

### 5. Improve with Analytics
Keep refining your agent.  
- Track performance with metrics like **containment, resolution, CSAT, and sentiment**.  
- Review where it works well and where it needs support.  
- Update prompts, integrations, or style based on insights.
