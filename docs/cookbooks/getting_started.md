Follow the below guidelines from our conversation design experts to build a bot that functions more like human: 

> Conversation Design | More Human Less Bot



## 1.	Build Conversation based on the persona	
* Create a persona and fix the bot's favorite topics. 
* Set the tone, phrases, lingo inline with the bot's persona.


## 2.	User Adoption	
* Build conversations according to your needs.
* Discoverability: Where does the user find the bot?
* More Channels, More Awesome.
* Horizontal Expansion
* Vertical Expansion

## 3.	Greeting Message: First Time Visitor	
* Welcome the visitor.
* Tell him/her on what the bot is capable of.
* Add human-like touch based on the Persona.
* Ask for introductions.
* Use the visitor’s name.

## 4.	Greeting Message: Revisiting Visitor	
* If the user returns to the bot, ‘remember’ him/her.
* If he’s left a use case midway, help him ‘revisit’ the use case and see if he’s still interested in it.
* Confirm on whether details like name, age, address remain unchanged.

## 5.	Meaningful follow-up questions	
* Build conversation with meaningful follow up questions.

## 6.	First Person vs Second Person	
* Remember that when you frame the bot’s response.
* First person ‘I’ refers to the bot. 
* Second person ‘You’ refers to the end user.

## 7.	Show the user what the bot is capable of 	
* Guide the end user about the bot’s purpose.
* Establish the most important use cases in the greeting message.

## 8.	Bot Persona: Brand Influence	
* Match the Persona with the brand. 
* Include the history, marketing slogans and taglines in accordance with the brand.

## 9.	Include Rich Text	
* Present the data in a way that everybody can interpret it without any confusion.
* Prefer to add images, GIFs, videos, and links whenever information exceeds the screen.

## 10.	Present Information in neat templates	
* For organized and structured conversation design, use table/row/icon/button/cards/carousel.
* This can help you condense the information and serve the purpose for the user and you.
* Information in the recommended templates can add elegance to the UI and take less time to disclose the matter.

## 11.	Acknowledge in simple terms/Acknowledge locations, names with proper capitalisation	
* Once the user types in a query, acknowledge him/her to ensure that the bot has ‘read’ the query and ‘understood’ it properly. This is especially important in a search bot.

## 12.	Avoid very strong Sentiment Phrases 	
* Frame phrases inline with the user’s possible inputs.
* Clue: Positive phrases like ‘Perfect’, ‘Great’ etc will not go well with the negative situation.

## 13.	Avoid Repetition	
* If you find a self explanatory use case, avoid mentioning the same in the greeting message.
* Also, avoid repeating sentences like 
    * Can you rephrase what you said?
    * Please try again.
    * Sorry, there seems to be a technical issue.
    *  so on...

## 14.  Discourse Markers	
* Intelligent use of discourse markers to have a human-like flow of conversation. 
* Discourse markers bridge sentences with logical connections. 
    Use words and phrases like:
    So...
    But…
    Further…
    Additionally...


## 15.	Mirror human conversation: No one liners/partial phrases	
* Do not frame bot responses that are not proper sentences. 
* And frame them keeping in mind how a human being would speak.
* Avoid one line responses; they look robotic.

## 16.	Acknowledge Delays in Bot Response	
* If the background API takes long time, let the  user know that the bot takes some time to fetch the details. 
* If the user doesn’t understand why bot is not responding, there is a high chance that he/she assumes that the bot is hanging.

## 17.	Include a delay between successive bot messages	
* When 2 or more bot responses appear in one go, include a slight time delay.
*  Time delay can help user to read the messages one by one.

## 18.	Easy to understand Text	
* The bot language should be simple, unambiguous and concise. 
* Do not confuse the user with terminology that a laymen does not understand. 

## 19.	Do not make user scroll much	
* When the bot gives out a response, the user should not scroll down much.
* Condense the information to fit the bot screen.
* Fit information into the screen.

## 20.	Optimise Search	
* Design efficient filters to get a finite number of search results. 
* The bot cannot present more than 10 search results in one go. 
* If the search results >10, ask further questions to filter results.
* In case there are several results even in the last filter, offer options to expand within a sub filter.
* If the information to be presented is too long, mention a redirection link titled ‘Read More’.
  

## 21.	Break texts into reader friendly blocks	
* If there are large chunks of text, people do not read them in full. So, break these chunks into reader friendly blocks.
* In text bots, start the sentence with the most important part of the message. 
Bad bot verbiage: 
In order to process your refund, I need your phone number.
Recommended bot verbiage: 
Please share your phone number so that I can process your refund.

## 22.	Design FAQ section to reduce confusion	
* Make sure that the bot is trained to answer all the queries when you encourage the user to type in any query. 
* Auto-completion feature helps user to get the job done easily.
*  Displaying keywords allow user to realize that their query will be resolved in further steps."

## 23.	Upsell	
* Do not deny or reject a query right away. 
* Try upselling, like a human agent would. 

## 24.	Confirmation before transaction	
* When the user gives answers to a series of 
questions, acknowledge all of them together.

## 25.	Handling Errors	
* Never miss to assume the unhappy path of the flow.
Here are a few scenario for which error handling texts are required.
Scenario 1: User leaves the bot hanging, without giving any input.
Scenario 2: User gives incorrect input.
Scenario 3:User has a legit query but it falls outside the bot’s scope.

## 26.	Handling Errors: Bot level checks for PAN, phone numbers etc	
* Acknowledge with reasons on why the input is invalid.
* If the PAN given by the user is of the wrong format, let the user know 
that the PAN is incorrect because it’s in the wrong format. 

## 27.	Closure: Every use case needs closure
* The bot should not stop with one use and hang right there. 
* Ask the user if he needs further help.
