sidebar_label : App to cloud migration guide
---

This is a starter guide for migrating from app.yellow.ai to cloud.yellow.ai. This document is designed to offer you clear instructions on the migration and the steps involved in making a successful transition. 

:::note
This guide is tailored for users who already have an account on app.yellow.ai and intend to migrate their existing bots to the cloud.yellow.ai platform. You **cannot** create new bots on app.yellow.ai.
:::

## Migration process

You'll begin by creating a new bot from scratch on cloud.yellow.ai and recreating all your flows, nodes, user data and every other data that was available on the app bot. Additionally, you have the option to export your client data from the app and [import it](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/cdp/user_data/import_users) into the web bot.  This transition ensures that you leverage the full potential of cloud bot capabilities.

## Benefits of moving to the cloud

By migrating to cloud.yellow.ai, you gain access to a range of exciting features that simplify the bot-building process. Here are some key advantages:

1. **Easy-to-use interface:** The no-code platform enables users of all skill levels to create advanced bots without writing code.
2. **Exceptional support:** The cloud platform offers dedicated support to assist you with any platform-related queries or issues.
3. **Enhanced user experience:** Enjoy a seamless and intuitive bot-building experience with user-friendly features and tools.

The app bots will not have feature updates or new releases, but the cloud bots offer a broader range of product capabilities. With cloud bots, you can benefit from improved analytics, better customer engagement, the ability to run bots on multiple channels, and seamless integration with other applications for efficient bot building.

2. Provide the necessary details and specifications for your new bot.
3. Design the conversation flow of your bot by adding [flows](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/Flows/journeys) and [nodes](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes).
4. [Test your bot](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/tools#21-test-your-bot) thoroughly to ensure its functionality.
5. [Publish your bot](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/test-and-publish-bot/modes) to make it available for users.
6. [Utilize campaigns](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/outbound/outbound-campaigns/run-campaign) and [live chats](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/inbox/chats/getstartedwithlivechat) to engage and assist your bot users.
7. Extend the reach of your bot by deploying it on [multiple channels](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/channelConfiguration/overview) and [integrating](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/appConfiguration/overview) it with third-party applications.
