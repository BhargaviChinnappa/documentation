## API events 

| Field        | Description   |
|--------------|---------------|
| TIMESTAMP    | The TIMESTAMP field represents time intervals in 1-minute slots within a 24-hour day. When an event occurs, its timestamp is rounded to the nearest 1-minute interval. The first occurrence creates a new row with the timestamp, and if the same event occurs again within the same 1-minute slot, the count column value for that timestamp is incremented by 1. This allows tracking the number of occurrences of the same event within each 1-minute interval. Subsequent occurrences in the same interval contribute to the count column value. For example: Suppose an event occurs at 9:46:24, its timestamp would be 9:46, creating a new row. If the same event happens at 9:46:37, the count becomes 2 for the 9:46 timestamp. Another event at 10:13:47 creates a new row with a timestamp of 10:13. The count column tracks repeated occurrences within the same 1-minute slot. |

| TIMESTAMP            | The TIMESTAMP field represents time intervals in 1-minute slots within a 24-hour day. When an event occurs, its timestamp is rounded to the nearest 1-minute interval. The first occurrence creates a new row with the timestamp, and if the same event occurs again within the same 1-minute slot, the count column value for that timestamp is incremented by 1. This allows tracking the number of occurrences of the same event within each 1-minute interval. Subsequent occurrences in the same interval contribute to the count column value. For example: Suppose an event occurs at 9:46:24, its timestamp would be 9:46, creating a new row. If the same event happens at 9:46:37, the count becomes 2 for the 9:46 timestamp. Another event at 10:13:47 creates a new row with a timestamp of 10:13. The count column tracks repeated occurrences within the same 1-minute slot. Ex: 00:00:00 UTC. |

## User engagement events

Following are the fields tracked on the user engagement events table: 

| Field            | Description                                                                                                          |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| TIMESTAMP        | The TIMESTAMP field represents time intervals in 30-minute slots within a 24-hour day. When an event occurs, its timestamp is rounded to the nearest 30-minute interval. The first occurrence creates a new row with the timestamp, and if the same event occurs again within the same 30-minute slot, the count column value for that timestamp is incremented by 1. This allows tracking the number of occurrences of the same event within each 30-minute interval. Subsequent occurrences in the same interval contribute to the count column value. For example: Suppose an event occurs at 9:46, its timestamp would be 9:30, creating a new row. If the same event happens at 9:59, the count becomes 2 for the 9:30 timestamp. Another event at 10:13 creates a new row with a timestamp of 10:00. The count column tracks repeated occurrences within the same 30-minute slot. |
| BID              | Business Identifier, a unique identifier for the business associated with the event.                                  |

| SESSIONID        | Unique Identifier of the User for a 24-hour timeframe from the first event triggered by the user.                     |
| LANGUAGE         | Language identified by the platform during the ongoing interaction.                                                    |
