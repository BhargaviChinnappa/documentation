title: Conversation logs
sidebar_label : Conversations
---

Conversation logs contain detailed records of every interaction between users and the AI-agent in chronological order. These logs include user inputs, AI-agent responses, timestamps, and any contextual data relevant to the interaction. They provide a complete history of conversations, helping AI-agent developers to understand how the AI-agent is performing, identify issues, and make improvements to enhance the user experience.

Chats are retained for six months; after this period, they are archived. You can still download them using [Data export](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/growth/dataops).

## Features available

Conversation logs provide a comprehensive set of tools for managing and analyzing conversations. Below is a detailed list of all the available features:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Filters & Search** | Filter conversations based on criteria such as date, source, labels, tags, nodes, and session ID (SID). <br/> Search for conversations using UID (User ID) or SID (Session ID) to pinpoint specific interactions. |
| **Logs** | View detailed logs for each message, including timestamps, actions taken by the AI-agent, and flow execution. <br/> View knowledge base search results related to the conversation, helping troubleshoot issues with document nodes. <br/> Inspect the flow and nodes triggered during the conversation to troubleshoot and improve AI-agent performance. |
| **Comments** | Add, reply to, and resolve comments on specific messages to communicate with team members about certain issues. |
| **Flag** | Flag conversations to revisit later for follow-up, review, or escalation, helping prioritize important interactions. |
| **Copy URL** | Share the conversation log URL with team members for easy access to specific interactions. |
| **User Details** | View important details about the user, including their UID, session information, and labels applied. |
| | **Labels**: Manually added by users to categorize conversations (e.g., for tracking complaints, feedback, etc.). |
|  |**Tags**: System-generated tags automatically assigned to conversations based on detected issues. |

## User session

A **user session** refers to a continuous interaction between a user and the AI-agent within a specific time window. A session starts when the user initiates a conversation with the AI-agent and ends when:
- [**Chat channels**](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/channelConfiguration/overview) (e.g., chat widget, WhatsApp, web apps): Sessions last for **24 hours** from the user's **first message** in that conversation window.             
- **Email channel**: There is **no fixed session duration** for email interactions. Since users may respond after several hours or even days, emails are handled as individual communications rather than a single continuous session.              
- **Voice calls**: The session ends **as soon as the call is disconnected**.               


Each user is identified by a **unique ID (UID)**, and a conversation log is generated for each UID. This log captures the full context of all interactions during the session. Each session has a **session ID (SID)**. 

> You can search for a particular conversation using **UID** or **SID** (Session ID) to locate specific sessions easily.

> **To get session ID of an Ongoing Conversation**, use `{{{session.id}}}`. This placeholder returns the unique identifier for the active conversation session.


**Session expiry explained**

- A session lasts for **24 hours** from the user's last message.
- If the user sends another message **within 24 hours**, the **same session continues**.
- If the user sends a message **after 24 hours**, a **new session starts**.

**Example scenarios**

| Scenario           | Timeline | User Action | Result |
|:-------------------|:---------|:------------|:-------|
| **Continued Session** | 9:00 AM - Start<br/>9:30 AM - Last message<br/>6:00 PM - Next message (same day) | User sends a message **within 24 hours** | Same session continues.<br/>Session expiry shifts to **6:00 PM next day**. |
| **New Session**       | 9:00 AM - Start<br/>9:30 AM - Last message<br/>9:31 AM - Next message (next day) | User sends a message **after 24 hours** | New session starts.<br/>Previous chat history is available, but **context is lost**. |

> Q1. How can I get the current session ID of an ongoing conversation?
> A: You can retrieve the session ID using `{{{session.id}}}`. This placeholder returns the unique identifier for the active conversation session.

:::note
When users starts a new session (after 24 hours), they can view the previous conversation history, but the context from the earlier session is not retained.
:::


:::note
By default, the names displayed in conversation logs are randomized to maintain end-user anonymity.  
To display actual user names, contact support team.

> You can share the URL with the specific user or team members.  


### Flag conversations

By flagging a conversation, you can easily mark it for review, follow-up, or escalation. This ensures that critical issues, such as unresolved complaints or urgent inquiries, are promptly addressed. Flagging also helps organize conversations for further analysis and improves the management of user interactions.

To flag a conversation, follow these steps:

1. Go to the desired conversation and click the **Flag** icon on the top right corner.                 
![image](https://imgur.com/QJ74wJp.png)                
2. To view your marked conversations, go to **Filters** > **Flagged Conversation** > **Apply filter**.

## Search and Filter 

You can Search and filter conversations to extract relevant and meaningful information from a large volume of chats. Filters help you quickly identify important interactions, better understand user queries, and troubleshoot problems.

To **filter** chat logs, follow these steps:

1. Click **Filters** on the top right corner.                            
![image](https://imgur.com/8EntQCA.png)

| **Tags**                 | Filter by system-generated tags, such as "Validator Limit Exceeded" or "Fallback Limit Exceeded." |
| **Flag conversation**| Filter conversations that are flagged for follow-up, review, or escalation. |
| **Labels**               | Filter conversations based on custom labels applied by users. |
| **Flows**                | Filter conversations associated with a particular journey, including step and drop-off specific filters. |
| **Nodes**                | Refine conversations based on specific nodes triggered. For example, filter all conversations where a phone number was collected. |
| **SID**                  | Filter conversations using the unique Session ID.|     


3. Click **Apply filter** after setting the criteria.          

> A red dot appears next to the field to indicate that a filter is applied.

**Search**

### Tags

The platform automatically assigns tags to conversations to highlight key events, making it easier for developers and analysts to troubleshoot.          
To view tags check the **Tags** column to see the status of the tags or open the chat and check the conversations. 

> You can view the node information when you open a tag, you can rectify the issue within [Automation (flows/nodes)](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/Flows/flows-overview). 

![](https://imgur.com/fOkcklY.gif)


**Available tags**

- **Validator limit exceeded**: Assigned when the validation limit is exceeded for a user input, indicating that the input was invalid (e.g., incorrect format or length).     
- **Missing bot response**: Assigned when the AI-agent fails to generate a response to the user.              
- **Unused quick replies**: Assigned when users respond with free text instead of selecting from the available quick replies, signaling potential usability issues.            
- **Fallback limit exceeded**: Assigned when the AI-agent triggers fallback multiple times and exceeds the set fallback limit.         
- **Unidentified**: Assigned when the AI-agent is unable to comprehend the userâ€™s input, often due to ambiguity or unclear phrasing.              
- **Human takeover**: Assigned when the conversation is handed over to a human agent for further assistance.

> You can filter conversations by these tags to monitor and address areas needing improvement.


### Labels

**Labels** are added manually by users to categorize and organize conversations. Labels make it easier to track specific types of interactions, such as complaints, inquiries, feedback, or technical issues. They help manage the flow of conversations and ensure that critical issues are addressed.

To label a chat, open a conversation. Under **User deatils**, add a label to the conversation by typing it.
