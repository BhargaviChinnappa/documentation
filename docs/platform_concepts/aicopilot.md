## Overview

Yellow.ai’s AI Help Center is a plug-and-play widget that integrates seamlessly into customer websites, serving as an all-in-one support portal. It enables users to interact with an AI-powered agent, raise tickets, access KnowledgeBase articles, and connect with live agents. AI-Copilot consolidates several key functionalities from Yellow.ai’s Inbox, KnowledgeBase, and ticketing system into a single, unified interface.

## Components of AI-Copilot

When the AI-Copilot widget is integrated into a website, it contains several important components designed to enhance the user experience:

### AI Agent interaction
Users can continue their interactions with an AI agent, receiving responses from pre-configured flows and KnowledgeBase articles.

### Live chat integration

If the AI agent cannot resolve the issue, users can connect to a live agent through the built-in chat functionality. If the issue can't be resolved immediately, the agent can create a support ticket.
- You must provide your details such as Name, Contact number and Email ID to verify OTP before connecting you to a live agent.

## Configure of AI-Copilot


Configuring the AI-Copilot is similar to setting up a normal AI agent on Yellow.ai. Ticket Escalation cab be additionally configured. 


### Configure ticket escalation

AI-Copilot includes the ability for users to escalate tickets to customer support teams. The escalation option is available on the ticket details page.

**Escalation Flow:**

When a user escalates a ticket, an event (`copilot-ui-escalate-ticket`) is triggered with the following data:
* **ticketId**: The ID of the ticket being escalated.
* **userId**: The CDP user ID of the individual escalating the ticket.

**Support Team Actions:**

The support team must configure their bot to handle this escalation event. For example, they may:
* Create an escalation flow that is triggered when the `copilot-ui-escalate-ticket` event is received.
* Inside this flow, they can add logic to alert the assigned support agent or initiate further investigation.

## Copilot deployment

AI-Copilot is deployed on customer websites through the following steps:

1. **Add Stylesheet to the HTML `<head>` tag**: Place the following line at the end of the `<head>` tag in your HTML file:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.yellowmessenger.com/plugin/copilot/latest/dist/assets/index.css" />
```

2. **Add configuration script:** Create the `window.__yc__` configuration script and place it at the bottom of the `<body>` tag:

```
    <script>
      window.__yc__ = {
        botId: "x1694470802970",  //Add your respective Bot ID
        host: "https://r4.cloud.yellow.ai", //Add link to the host URL, chamge the region if required 
        logo: {
          src: "https://cdn.yellowmessenger.com/assets/images/yellow-logo.svg", // Add link of your logo image and define its dimensions
          alt: "Yellow.ai",
          favicon: "https://cdn.yellowmessenger.com/assets/icons/glyph.png",
          width: 85,
          height: 20,
        },
      };
    </script>
  
```

3. **Add Copilot JavaScript to your website:** After the above script, add the following JavaScript tag just below the closing `</body>` tag:

`script src="https://cdn.yellowmessenger.com/plugin/copilot/latest/dist/index.js"></script>`

Once this code is added to your website, the Copilot widget will be deployed and ready for use.

**Example deployment code**:


```
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- Title of the page displayed in the browser tab -->
    <title>Yellow Help Center</title>

    <!-- Link to the Copilot widget's CSS stylesheet for styling -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.yellowmessenger.com/plugin/copilot/latest/dist/assets/index.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Script to configure the Copilot widget -->
    <script>
      window.__yc__ = {
        // The unique bot ID that identifies the specific bot to use
        botId: "x1694470802970",
        
        // Host URL where the bot's backend services are hosted
        host: "https://r4.cloud.yellow.ai",
        
        // Logo configuration for the Copilot widget
        logo: {
          // Source URL for the logo image
          src: "https://cdn.yellowmessenger.com/assets/images/yellow-logo.svg",
          
          // Alt text for the logo image
          alt: "Yellow.ai",
          
          // Favicon for the website, displayed in browser tabs
          favicon: "https://cdn.yellowmessenger.com/assets/icons/glyph.png",
          
          // Width and height settings for the logo image
          width: 85,
          height: 20,
        },
      };
    </script>

    <!-- Script to load and initialize the Copilot widget -->
    <script src="https://cdn.yellowmessenger.com/plugin/copilot/latest/dist/index.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>

```

        
### Existing customizations 
    
Once the deployment code has been added to the webpage (as mentioned earlier), the following elements can be customized:

* **AI-Agent configuration**: The same configuration used for Yellow.ai web widgets applies here, including language settings and other preferences.
* **Logo customization**: You can add a custom logo to the Copilot interface by modifying the `window.__yc__.logo` configuration in the script.
* **Translation**: Users can enable translation to switch the language of the AI-Agents messages, but the entire website will remain in English.


### Upcoming features and customizations

Currently, some customization options are controlled from the **backend**, but they will soon be made available for user configuration. These features include:

* **Suggested queries**: Customize the four default queries displayed to users.
* **Callout messages**: Ability to modify the “We are here to help you” message.
* **Documentation link**: Modify or add documentation links in the "Go to Documentation" button.
* **Website language**: Switch the language of the entire website, including the AI-agents’s messages and other fields.
* **Account access**: Currently, access is limited to Yellow.ai credentials. However, authentication can also be configured on the client’s end.
