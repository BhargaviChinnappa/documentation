The following are the domain URLs of data centres on different regions:
1. .in - https://api.in.freshchat.com/v2 
2. .eu - https://api.eu.freshchat.com/v2 
3. .au - https://api.au.freshchat.com/v2 and if the domain value is just msdk.freshchat.com, then it belongs to USA data center and hence the value that needs to be configured is https://api.freshchat.com/v2


### 1.2 Enable the integration in Yellow.ai's Integration module

4. If you have multiple accounts, follow the above mentioned steps to add each of them.

:::note
1. Enter a unique name for each account to easily identify them within the yellow.ai platform. It is recommended to use a name that aligns with its purpose for better usability. 
2. You can add a maximum of 15 accounts.
3. In a two-tier environment, such as bots with only Development/Live environments, you can add account names only in the development mode. Once added and flows have been built, in the Live mode, you can only choose the account names and not edit them.
4. In a three-tier environment, such as bots with Staging/Sandbox/Production modes, in Staging and Sandbox modes, you can add and edit new accounts. However, in Production, only the account details added in Staging will be available. You can only map in the production environment.

1. Login to the **Freshchat** portal as an administrator.
