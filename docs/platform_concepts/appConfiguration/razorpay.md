title : Razorpay integration
sidebar_label : Razorpay
---

You can integrate your Yellow.ai platform with your Razorpay account, enabling you to accept payments from your end users. Additionally, this integration allows you to perform various other actions, including:

* Generate a payment link and receive the status (success/failure) of the payment.
* Generate a payment link to receive partial payments and receive the status (success/failure) of the payments.
* Initiate refund process.
* Check refund status. 

## 1. Connect Razorpay with Yellow.ai

Connect your Yellow.ai platform with your Razorpay account by following the below-mentioned steps.

### 1.1 Generate API keys on Razorpay dashboard

1. Log into your [Razorpay account](https://dashboard.razorpay.com/signin?screen=sign_in&utm_medium=website&utm_source=direct) and select the mode (Test/Live) for which you want to generate the API key.

    ![](https://i.imgur.com/74zbT2o.png)


* **Test Mode**: The test mode is a simulation mode in which you can test your integration flow. Your customers cannot make payments in this mode. Check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwiv6zSVVCM) to know more.
* **Live Mode**: When your integration is complete, switch to **Live** mode and generate live mode API keys. Replace test mode keys with live mode keys in the integration to accept payments from customers.Check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30REpNtYSak) to know more.

2. To generate API keys for a specific mode**, navigate to **Settings** > **API Keys** > **Generate Key** to generate key for the selected mode.

3. The **Key Id** and **Key Secret** will appear on the following page. Downalod them to use in your Yellow.ai platform.

### 1.2 Integrate Razorpay with yellow.ai platform

In a two-tier environment, you can connect an integration app in the Development environment. In a three-tier environment, you can connect the integration app either in Staging or Sandbox. All connected integrations are available in the live environment.


To connect your Stripe account with Yellow.ai, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the Development/Staging environment and go to **Extensions** > **Integrations** > **Payment**  > **Razorpay**. You can also search for **Razorpay** in the search box.


    ![](https://cdn.yellowmessenger.com/assets/yellow-docs/razorpay.png)


2. In **Give account name**, enter a unique name for the integration. You can use only lowercase alphanumeric characters and underscores (_).
3. In **Key ID** and **Key secret**, enter the respective values that you downloaded using the steps mentioned in the previous section.
4. CLick **Connect**.

    ![](https://cdn.yellowmessenger.com/assets/yellow-docs/razorpay-details.png)

5. To add another account, click **+ Add account** and proceed with the previous steps. You can add a maximum of 15 accounts.

### 1.3 Configure webhook URL in Razorpay Dashboard 

The Webhook URL serves as a callback URL where Razorpay can send notifications or data updates to your bot. 

1. Copy the webhook URL and the API key mentioned in the **Instructions** section of the Razorpay Integration Card. Append the region of your bot to the domain of the webhook url. r1/r2/r3/r4/r5 are the regions of your bot, you can refer the following list for the same.  (r1 = MEA, r2 = Jakarta, r3 = Singapore, r4= USA, r5 = Europe)
<br/>For example, if the domain is https://cloud.yellow.ai, you need to change it to https://r1.cloud.yellow.ai if the region of the bot is MEA. If the bot belongs to India, you can use origin domain itself.

    ![](https://cdn.yellowmessenger.com/assets/yellow-docs/razorpay.png)

2. Log into the [Razorpay Dashboard](https://dashboard.razorpay.com/#/access/signin) and navigate to **Settings** → **Webhooks**.
3. Click **+ Add New Webhook** on the right corner.

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/aE5zgwH.png)

4. In the **Webhook Setup** pop-up, enter the URL in which you'd like to receive the webhook payload when an event is triggered. We recommend using a **HTTPS URL**. Ensure you enable all the events shown in the screenshot below.

   <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Zfsj8ub.png" alt="drawing" width="80%"/>

:::note
You can set upto 10 URLs to receive Webhook notifications. Webhooks can only be delivered to public URLs. If you attempt to save a localhost endpoint as part of a webhook setup, you will encounter an error.
:::

5. Enter a **Secret** for the webhook endpoint. This secret will be used to validate whether the webhook is from **RazorPay**. Do not expose this secret publicly. Click [here](https://razorpay.com/docs/webhooks/validate-test/) to know more validating webhooks. 
6. In the **Alert Email** field, enter the email address to which the notifications should be sent in case there's a webhook failure.
7. Select the required events from the list of **Active Events**.
8. Click **Create Webhook**. After you set a webhook, it appears on the list of webhooks.

:::note
To modify the webhook further, you can select the webhook and click **Edit**. You can refer this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qojkh8Vbnek) as well.
:::

## Enable Razorpay events in your bot

Enable Razorpay events in your bot to trigger flows based on event occurrences, allowing seamless integration of payment processes with bot functionalities.

1. In Development/Staging environment, go to **Automation** > **Event** > **Integrations**.
2. Activate the event, **Razorpay Payment Status**. Click on the more options icon and select *Activate*. If there are multiple accounts, you need to activate for each account separately. 

 ![](https://cdn.yellowmessenger.com/assets/yellow-docs/razor-activate.png)

3. A journey with its trigger point as this event should be created in **Automation**. Based on the received event data, an appropriate message will be displayed to the end user.

   <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Bs6iIH8.png" width="80%"/>

:::info
If you have added multiple accounts in your platform, enable events for each of those accounts.
:::
