3. Generate Your API Credentials
   - On the Developers page, go to the section **“API Credentials”** and click **"Generate Credentials"** or **"Create New App"**, if prompted.
You will receive **API Key**, **Auth Token**, and **Private Salt**.

:::note
Credentials vary between **Test Mode** and **Live Mode**. Use **test credentials** while integrating for testing, and **live credentials** only when you're ready for production.

* __Test Mode:__ This mode is intended for testing purposes and for developers who are just beginning their integration with Instamojo. Test Mode is completely free of charge but requires completion of KYC (Know Your Customer) verification. No actual charges will be incurred, even if valid card details are provided on the [Instamojo test environment](https://test.instamojo.com) for sign-up.
* __Live mode__: In Live Mode, transactions occur in real-time, and actual charges apply. To operate in Live Mode, users must provide their bank account information and complete the KYC (Know Your Customer) process. This ensures compliance with regulatory requirements and enables seamless processing of payments. To get started with Live Mode, visit [Instamojo's website](https://www.instamojo.com/) and sign up for an account.

|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Amount***                     | The exact amount to be charged from the customer. This should be a numeric value, typically in INR (e.g., 499.00).                                             |
| **Customer email***             | The email address of the customer who will receive the payment link. This is used for communication and transaction tracking.                                 |

| **Send SMS***                  | A boolean value (`true` or `false`). If `true`, the payment link will also be sent via SMS to the customer's mobile number.                                   |
| **Status callback URL***        | The endpoint (URL) where Instamojo should send status updates about the payment (e.g., success, failure). Useful for backend workflows and confirmation logic.
