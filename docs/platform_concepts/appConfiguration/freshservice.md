Integrating Freshservice ITSM with Yellow.ai enables the following actions:

* [Display list of active tickets requiring resolution](#11-see-list-of-all-tickets-list-all-tickets).
* [Check the status of a specific ticket](#12-ticket-status).
* [Create a new IT-related ticket](#13-create-ticket).


## Connecting Freshservice ITSM with your bot


In a two-tier environment, you can connect an integration app in the Development environment.  In a three-tier environment, you can connect the integration app either in Staging or Sandbox. All connected integrations are available in the live environment.

To connect Freshservice ITSM, follow these steps:

1. Switch to the Development/Staging environment.

2. On the left navigation bar, click **Extensions** > **Integrations** > **ITSM** > **Freshservice ITSM**. Alternatively, you can search for the integration using the Search app.

3. **Give account name** (only lowercase alphanumeric and `_` are supported), and enter the **API Key** (This key will be provided by the client/freshservice spoc of the client), and **Domain name**.

:::note
The format of this field should be `https://yellowtest.freshservice.com/api/v2` and this is also to be provided by the client/freshservice spoc of the client.
:::

4. Click **Connect**.  The integration will be enabled for the bot.

5. To add another account, repeat the above mentioned steps. You can add a maximum of 15 accounts.



## Perform Freshservice actions through Agent Conversations

Once the integration is successful, you can access the following Freshservice functions directly from the Yellow.ai bot.
