3. Fill in all the mandatory fields. The below-mentioned table consists of the sample value, data type and description for all these fields.


| Field Name | Sample Value | Data type |Description|

4. The **Generate Payment Link** Integration Action Node has two outcomes, success or failure. If the payment link is generated successfully, the **Integration Action Node** returns a **Success** response code as shown below.


```json
{
      "url": "https://uat.billdesk.com/MercOnline/URLRenderer/C7g",
       "status": "success"
      }

```

If generating payment link fails, the **Integration Action Node** returns a **Failure** response code as shown below.

```json
{
"errorCode": "<<Error Code>>"
"errorMessage": "<<Error Message/Description>>"
"status": "failed"
}
```

To use this **Integration Action Node** in an app.yellow.ai bot, refer the following example:

```
app.executeIntegrationAction({
  "integrationName": "billdesk-emailpay",
  "action": "Generate payment link",
  "dynamicParams": {
    "amount": 10.00,
    "customerName": "John",
    "customerMobileNumber": "9955557879",
    "orderId": "TestOrder123",
    "sendEmail": "false"
  }
}).then((res) => {
  console.log("response from action node", res);
  app.log(res, '||Response from action node||')
}).catch((err) => {
  console.log("Error in action node", err);
  app.log(err, '||Error in action node||')
})

```
