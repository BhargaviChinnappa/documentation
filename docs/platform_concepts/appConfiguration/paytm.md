Yellow.ai Integration with Paytm Payment Gateway enables the end user to do the following:

1. Generate a payment link and receive an intimation regarding the status of the payment as to whether it was a success or failure.
2. Initiate the process of refund.
3. Check the status of the refund that was initiated.

## Connect Paytm payment gateway with Yellow.ai

In a two-tier environment, you can connect an integration app in the Development environment. In a three-tier environment, you can connect the integration app either in Staging or Sandbox. All connected integrations are available in the live environment.


To integrate the Paytm payment gateway, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the Development/Staging environment and go to **Extensions** > **Integrations** > **Payment**  > **Paytm**. You can also search the integration by name **Paytm** using the Search box.

2. In **Give account name**, enter a unique name for the integration. You can use only lowercase alphanumeric characters and underscores (_).
   
   ![](https://cdn.yellowmessenger.com/assets/yellow-docs/paytm-details.png)

3. In **Merchant ID**,  enter the Merchant ID provided by the client or Paytm SPOC.  
4. In **Merchant Key** enter the Merchant Key provided by the client or Paytm SPOC.
5. In **API Domain**, If you intend to use the staging domain of Paytm, enter `https://securegw-stage.paytm.in`. If you're using the production domain, enter `https://securegw.paytm.in`.

6. In **Channel ID**, enter the Channel ID provided by the client or Paytm SPOC.

7. **Industry Type:** Enter the Industry Type provided by the client or Paytm SPOC.

8. To add more accounts, click **+ Add account** and proceed with the previous steps. You can add a maximum of 15 accounts.


## Configure Webhook URL in Paytm

The webhook URL serves as a callback endpoint where Paytm can send notifications or updates regarding payment events, enabling your application to respond accordingly.


1. Go to the connected Paytm integration and copy the webhook URL. 
2. Add domain URL. Append the region of your bot to the domain of the webhook url. r1/r2/r3/r4/r5 are the regions of your bot, you can refer the following list for the same. (r1 = MEA, r2 = Jakarta, r3 = Singapore, r4= USA, r5 = Europe)

   ![](https://cdn.yellowmessenger.com/assets/yellow-docs/paytm-webhook.png)


3. Login to your Paytm account and navigate to the Webhook URL Configuration section and add the provided webhook URL.

## Enable Paytm event for your bot

1. On the Cloud Platform go to Staging/Development environment.
2. On the left navigation bar, click **Automation** > **Event** > **Integrations** and search for `Paytm Payment Status`.
3. Click on the more options icon and select Activate. If you have connected multiple accounts, you need to enable the event for each account.
4. Once the event is activated, you can create a flow in the **Automation** > **Build** and use the event in a flow to trigger a specific action, such as displaying a message indicating that the payment is completed successfully.

## Paytm actions through bot conversation

Once your Paytm account is successfully connected, your bot can perform the following actions:

:::note
If there are multiple accounts, you can select from which account you want to perform the action.

### Generate Paytm payment link in bot conversation

1. Go to Development/Staging environment and navigate to **Automation** > **Build** > Select the flow where you want to add the Generate payment link node.

2. Click **Add node** > **Integrations** > **Paytm**.

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/7r0Td7w.png)

3. You will see the Paytm node. In the first drop-down (actions), choose *Generate Payment Link*.

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/mA9hm4Q.png)

3. Configure the input parameters needed to generate the payment link by referring to the descriptions provided in the table below.

    | Field name | Sample value |  Data type   | Description |
    | -------- | -------- | --- | -------- |
    | Timestamp     | 1588402269     | String    | EPOCH timestamp of the time at which the request is being sent    |
    |Amount|3500|String|Transaction amount|
    |LinkName|Test|String|Name of the link that you want to display to the customer, link name is used to generate a long URL|
    |LinkType|FIXED|String|Type of link|
    |LinkDescription|Test|String|Description of the link that you want to display to the customer|
    |SendSms|true/false|Boolean|Flag whether SMS is to be sent to the customer by Paytm|

:::note
An easy way to determine the success or failure of an action is by inspecting the key tokenType in the head object. If its value is **AES**, the response indicates success.
:::


**Sample response for success**

In case of success, you must extract the key **shortUrl** present in the **body** object and display it to the end user with an appropriate message with the help of any of the **Message type** nodes.

```

### Check Refund Status

1. In the Paytm node, choose the action *Check Refund Status*.

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/7r0Td7w.png)

2. Configure the input parameters needed to generate the payment link by referring to the descriptions provided in the table below.

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/W4AMMOB.png)


| Field name | Sample value |  Data type   | Description |
| -------- | -------- | --- | -------- |
|RequestTimestamp|1588402269|String|EPOCH timestamp of the time at which the request is being sent|

:::note
The easiest way to identify success/failure is by looking at the key resultStatus in the resultInfo object. If its value is TXN_SUCCESS, the response is a success.

**Sample response for success**

In case of success, extract the key(s) and display to the end user an appropriate message with the help of any of the Message type nodes.
