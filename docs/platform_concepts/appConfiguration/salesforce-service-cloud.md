Salesforce is a cloud-based software company that provides a range of business solutions. At its core, Salesforce offers Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software, which helps businesses manage and analyze customer interactions and data. The CRM system allows companies to track sales, marketing efforts, customer service, and other aspects of their operations.

In addition to CRM, Salesforce has various subsidiaries and products that extend its capabilities. For instance, they offer live chat solutions to facilitate real-time customer support and engagement. Yellow.ai supports integration with Salesforce CRM and [Salesforce Live Chat](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/appConfiguration/salesforcelivechat). 

:::note
To configure Salesforce CRM, the user account must have Super Adminâ€“level permissions.

:::note
1. In a two-tier environment, such as bots with only Development/Live environments, you can add account names only in the development mode. Once added and flows have been built, in the Live mode, you can only choose the account names and not edit them.
2. In a three-tier environment, such as bots with Staging/Sandbox/Production modes, in Staging and Sandbox modes, you can add and edit new accounts. However, in Production, only the account details added in Staging will be available. You can only map in the production environment.

## Manage your Salesforce CRM through bot conversations

To carry out a certain action in your Salesforce account, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Automation** and [create a flow](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/Flows/journeys#2-create-a-flow) based on your requirement. 

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/Wcacej3.png)

2. In whichever point you want the bot to access Salesforce, include the Salesforce CRM node. For that, drag the node connector, go to **Integrations** > **Salesforce CRM**.

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/YVDlhAu.png)

3. In the Salesforce CRM node, fill in the following

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/LtUHOev.png)

* **Account name:** Choose the preferred Salesforce CRM account.
* **Action:** Choose the action to be performed.
* **Select Objects:** Choose the Salesforce CRM object in which the chosen action should be performed.
* Depending on the selected object, the corresponding fields will be shown. To collect this information from users, you must construct the flow accordingly and [store the data in variables](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/bot-variables#41-store-data-in-variables). These variables will then be used in this context.


4. Each Salesforce action returns a response as a JSON object or an array. [Store that response in a variable](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/bot-variables#41-store-data-in-variables) and [pass that variable](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/bot-variables#42-retrieve-data-from-variables) in a [message node](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/message-nodes1/message-nodes) to display that response to the end user.

| Action                                                             | Syntax                                                                                    |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| To consume the JSON object as it is                                | `{{variables.variable_name_object.choices.0.text}}`                                       |
| To access fields in JSON object response                           | `{{variables.variable_name.field_name}}`                                                  |
| To access array values| Use keys. For instance, to access the weather description from the below response, use<br/> `{{variables.API_var.weather.0.description}}`                                                                    because the value is inside an array and is the first value (0th index).|
  

**Sample response:**

```
{
  "coord": {
    "lon": 77.2167,
    "lat": 28.6667
  },
  "weather": [
    {
      "id": 761,
      "main": "Dust",
      "description": "dust",
      "icon": "50d"
    }
  ],
}
```
