Integrating Zendesk with Yellow.ai allows you to create offline support tickets. This ensures that users can raise the offline support requests even when live agents are unavailable.

When live agents are offline, Zendeskâ€™s offline ticketing system allows you to create offline support request. These requests are then converted into support tickets in Zendesk. Once agents are available, they can access these tickets and follow up with users via email to resolve their queries. 


**Key benefits of using this Integration**:

* **Creating offline tickets**: Generates the support tickets from offline messages when the agents are unavailable.
* **User management:** Allows the addition of new users, retrieval of user details, and creation of offline support requests within Zendesk.
