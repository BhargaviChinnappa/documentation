For businesses using Amazon Connect for contact center support, the Amazon Connect Live Chat integration enables your Yellow.ai AI Agent to escalate conversations to a live Amazon Connect agent when needed. Using the **Raise Ticket** node in the agent flow, you can trigger a live chat session, allowing end users to seamlessly transition from bot-driven conversations to real-time agent support on Amazon Connect.

## 1. Prerequisites

Before integrating Amazon Connect Live Chat with Yellow.ai, ensure you have the following details from your AWS account: 

- **[Region](#-region)**: AWS region where your Amazon Connect instance is hosted. Once you login to the console, you can see the Region ID in the Select Region and in the URL.
- **[Access Key ID & Secret Access Key](#-access-key--secret)**: IAM user credentials with appropriate Amazon Connect permissions.
- **[Instance ID](#-instance-id)**: Found in your Amazon Connect ARN.
- **[Contact Flow ID](#-contact-flow-id)**: Unique ID of the contact flow used for chat.
   1. On **AWS Management**, navigate to the **Amazon Connect console**. 
   2. Go to the **Instances** page console and select your Connect instance. 
   3. On the **Routing** tab, you'll see a list of contact flows. 
   4. Click on the specific contact flow you want to find the ID for. 
   The Contact Flow ID will be part of the ARN displayed in the overview.

## 2. Find required AWS Parameters

### üåç Region

To find the **AWS Region** (specifically for your Amazon Connect instance), follow these steps:


#### Option 1: From the Amazon Connect Console

1. **Go to** the [Amazon Connect console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/connect/).
2. On the **Instances** page, locate your instance.
3. The **Region** is shown in the URL and instance details.
   For example:

   ```
   https://<instance-alias>.awsapps.com/connect/home
   ```

   * If the URL is `https://my-support.awsapps.com/connect/home`, the region can often be inferred from the instance's full ARN (see below).

#### Option 2: From the Instance ARN

1. In the Amazon Connect console, go to your instance's **Account overview**.
2. Copy the **Instance ARN**.
   Example:

   ```
   arn:aws:connect:us-east-1:123456789012:instance/abcd1234-ef56-gh78-ij90-klmnopqrstuv
   ```
3. The **third segment** in the ARN (`us-east-1`) is the **Region** where your instance is hosted.


  **Region examples**

  | Region Name           | Region Code    |
  | --------------------- | -------------- |
  | US East (N. Virginia) | `us-east-1`    |
  | US West (Oregon)      | `us-west-2`    |
  | Asia Pacific (Mumbai) | `ap-south-1`   |
  | Europe (Frankfurt)    | `eu-central-1` |

### üîê Access Key & Secret

To generate an access key and secret for an IAM user:

1. Sign in to the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/) as an IAM user with appropriate permissions.
2. Navigate to **IAM** ‚Üí **Users**.
3. Select the desired user.
4. Go to the **Security credentials** tab.
5. Under **Access keys**, click **Create access key**.

6. Choose **Command Line Interface (CLI)** as the use case.
7. Click **Next**, then **Create access key**.
8. Download and securely store the access key ID and secret access key.([AWS Documentation][1], [AWS Documentation][2])

:::note
*  It is recommended to avoid using root user credentials for daily tasks. If necessary, root users can create access keys by navigating to **My Security Credentials** in the AWS Console and selecting **Create access key** under the **Access keys** section. ([AWS Documentation][3])

### üÜî Instance ID

To locate your Amazon Connect Instance ID:

1. Open the [Amazon Connect console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/connect/).
2. On the **Instances** page, select your instance alias.
3. On the **Account overview** page, in the **Distribution settings** section, find the **Instance ARN**.
4. The Instance ID is the segment following `instance/` in the ARN.([AWS Documentation][4])

*Example ARN:*

```

arn:aws:connect:us-east-1:123456789012:instance/abcd1234-ef56-gh78-ij90-klmnopqrstuv
```

*Here, `abcd1234-ef56-gh78-ij90-klmnopqrstuv` is the Instance ID.*&#x20;

### üîÅ Contact Flow ID

To create Contact Flow ID, you need to have the contact flow and the Amazon Connect instance in the same AWS Region to avoid region conflicts.

To retrieve the Contact Flow ID:

1. Sign in to the [Amazon Connect console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/connect/) with an Admin account or an account assigned to a security profile that has permissions to view contact flows.
2. In the navigation pane, choose **Routing**, then **Contact flows**.
3. Select the desired contact flow.
4. Click **Show additional flow information** to view the Flow ID.([AWS Documentation][6])
