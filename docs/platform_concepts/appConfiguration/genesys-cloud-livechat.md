Yellow.ai connects with Genesys Purecloud Live, enabling users to interact with live agents. This integration helps by linking live agents from your Genesys Purecloud account with users assisted by your yellow.ai bot.

## Prerequisites

1. An active Geneysys Purecloud live account 
2. An active Yellow.ai account

:::info
Only text and images are being supported from both the user and agent side.
:::

## Obtain integration credentials from Genesys Purecloud

To connect your Yellow.ai platform with Genesys Purecloud account, you need to perform the following actions in your Genesys Purecloud account to obtain the credentials to input in your Yellow.ai platform.

### Step 1: Create a user role

Create a custom role with certain scopes and assign that custom role to the user profile responsible for handling incoming chats from yellow.ai bot. To do so:

1. Go to **Admin** > **Roles/ Permissions**.

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/QhEagUJ.png)

2. Click **+Add role**.

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/o7J1nzr.png)

3. In **Role Details** enter a name for the role and describe it. Click **Permissions** and enable the below mentioned scopes for the role. You can search for the scopes in the highlighted search box and click **Save**.

* Messaging > Integration > All Permissions
* Conversation > Message > All Permissions
* Process Automation > Trigger > All Permissions

### Step 2: Create an OAuth client

You need to create an OAuth client to retrieve Client ID and Client secret for your Genesys login. This OAuth client is created for the role you created in the previous step. 

1. Go to **Admin** > **Integrations** > **OAuth**.

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/2Yy4RS7.png)

2. Click **+ Add client**.

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/XcLUGJO.png)

3. Enter a name for your app and choose **Client Credentials** under **Grant type**.

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/qBF8j0R.png)

4. Go to **Roles** and choose the custom role you created in the previous section.

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/BsS1Tdb.png)

5. Click **Save**.

 OAuth client gets created. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/D7hP75v.png)

### Step 3: Add Yellow.ai's webhook in Genesys

You need to create an integration to add Yellow.ai's webhook in Genesys. This helps Genesys to inform the Yellow.ai bot about user chat actions, such as drop-offs, responses, or chat endings.

1. Go to **Admin** > **Message** > **Platforms** > + **Create new integration** > **Open Messaging**.

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/qu2dlgQ.png)

2. Fill in the following fields:

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/DZWglvD.png)

* In **Name**, enter a name for your integration.
* In **Outbound Notification Webhook URL**, enter https://cloud.yellow.ai/ or any test URL.

:::info
A webhook is generated once the integration is established in Yellow.ai. Initially, you can provide a test URL to configure the integration. After setting it up, we'll retrieve the webhook from Yellow.ai. We will show the process in the upcoming steps.
:::

iii. In **Outbound Notification Webhook Signature Secret Token**, enter an integration ID and click **Save**.

3. Once you save, your integration ID will be generated. Copy it from the URL.

![](https://i.imgur.com/0mCNx1A.png)

### Step 4: Add a message route

Message route helps in rotuing the messages from bot to the live agent on Genesys.

1. Create a flow in Genesys Purecloud. This flow should be based on the process the chat should reach the agent. Click [here](https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/create-call-flow/#:~:text=Create%20an%20inbound%20call%20flow&text=The%20Create%20Flow%20dialog%20box,the%20flow's%20default%20supported%20language.) for steps.
2. After creating the flow, go to **Admin** > **Routing** > **Message Routing**.

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/s0w26rW.png)

3. Click **+** in right corner.

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/mraN0mi.png)

4. Select the flow you created in 1 and in **Addresses** select the integration you created in the previous step. Click **Save**.

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/WVVIFoX.png)

## Authenticate Genesys Purecloud Live in Yellow.ai

Enter the Client ID, Client Secret and integration ID obtained from the previous sections.

1. On the [Cloud platform](https://cloud.yellow.ai), navigate to the Development/Staging environment and go to **Extensions** >  **Integrations** > search for **Genesys Purecloud Live**.

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/iC3Vb3g.png)

2. Fill in the following fields:

* **Give account name:** enter a unique name for the integration. You can use only lowercase alphanumeric characters and underscores (_).
* **Host URL:** The URL of your genesys account.
* **Client ID:** Client obtained in [Step 2](#step-2-create-an-oauth-client).
* **Client Secret:** Client Secret obtained in [Step 2](#step-2-create-an-oauth-client).
* **Integration ID:** Integration ID obtained in [Step 3](#step-3-add-yellowais-webhook-in-genesys).

3. Click **Connect**.
4. To add another account, click **+ Add account** and proceed with the previous steps. You can add a maximum of 15 accounts.
5. Once the integration is setup, copy the Webhook URL by clicking on it. 

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/c3e2f31.png)
   
6. Go to your **Genesys Purecloud Live account** > **Admin** > **Message** > **Platforms** > integration you created in Step 3. > **Configure**

### Create Data Actions

#### chat-start

1. Navigate to  **Admin** Tab > **Integrations** > **Actions**.
2. Add a new action.
3. In **Integration name**,  select *Web services data actions* and enter the **Action name** as *chat-start*.
   
   ![](https://i.imgur.com/z1qns2T.png)

4. Go to **Setup** and select **Input Contract**.
5. Switch the format from **Simple** to **JSON** and enter the following JSON data: 

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "userId": {
      "description": "Agent ID",
      "type": "string"
    },
    "to": {
      "description": "To Address",
      "type": "string"
    },
    "conversationId": {
      "description": "Conversation ID",
      "type": "string"
    },
    "eventName": {
      "description": "Event Name",
      "default": "chat-start",
      "type": "string"
    }
  },
  "additionalProperties": true
}
```

6. Configure **Request URL template** as explained below:

   1. Navigate  to the **Configuration** section.
   2. In **Request URL template**, paste the webhook URL you copied from the Yellow.ai bot.
   3. Choose *POST* as the **Method**.
   4. Click **Save & Publish** to apply the changes.

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/zyhJdBp.png)

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/h3N7MIO.png)

#### chat-end

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "userId": {
      "description": "Agent ID",
      "type": "string"
    },
    "to": {
      "description": "To Address",
      "type": "string"
    },
    "conversationId": {
      "description": "Conversation ID",
      "type": "string"
    },
    "eventName": {
      "description": "Event Name",

## Connect bot users to live agents on Genesys

:::info
Use **Ticket-closed** in the **Raise Ticket node** to perform specific actions when a live chat closes, instead of using the **ticket-close** event.
:::

1. Go to **Automation** and [build a flow](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/Flows/journeys#2-create-a-flow) based on how you want the bot to take the user through the process.
2. Navigate to the desired point in a flow where you want to let the user talk to Genesys live agent and add the [Raise ticket node](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/action-nodes-overview/raise-ticket).  

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/7GNgHeo.png)

3. In **Live chat agent**, choose *Genesys PureCloud Live Agent*.

   <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ka5RZqf.png" width="60%"/>


3. Configure the node based on the descriptions provided in the following table. The variables chosen for these fields must be previously collected in the flow via node. To know more about this in detail, click [here](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/bot-variables#41-store-data-in-variables).

   | Field name | Data type | Description | Sample value |
   |------------|-----------|-------------|--------------|
   | Live chat agent | - | - | Choose **Genesys PureCloud Live agent** in the drop-down |
   | Account name | String | Choose the Genesys account to which the chats should be transferred | account1 |
   | Message after ticket assignment | String | The message that will be displayed to the end user after a ticket is successfully assigned to an agent | Requesting live agent connection. |
   | Name | String | Name of the end user | John |
   | Mobile | String | Mobile number of the end user | 9800000000 |
   | Email | String | Email address of the end user. This is a mandatory field | test@gmail.com |
   | Query | String | The subject/topic/reason why the ticket was created | I have a concern regarding my flight ticket |
   | Priority | String | The priority of the ticket | MEDIUM |
   | Genesys Cloud Live Agent Custom Fields | String | Choose the variable where custom fields are stored. To include first name, last name, and nickname as custom fields,use the following params| ``` { "genesysCloudUserFirstName": "Jim", "genesysCloudUserLastName": "James", "genesysCloudUserNickname": "Jam"}```
   | Advanced options | - | Enable this option to access advanced settings for the Genesis Live Chat integration with Bot. | -
   | Send chat transcript |  - | Enable this option to automatically send the conversation history between the end user and the bot as the initial message to the agent. If you don’t want to send the chat transcript to the agent, pass the value False. <br/> **Note**: In cases where the entire transcript exceeds the character limit of a single message packet in Salesforce, the content will be divided and sent as multiple message packets. For example, if the chat transcript contains 8000 characters and the message packet limit is 4000 characters, the transcript will be divided into two packets of 4000 characters each and sent as separate messages to the agent. | 
   | Custom chat transcript | String |  Select your preferred variable to send chat transcripts in the format of your choice. Please indicate your preferred format in the variable. |


**Result:**

**On Yellow.ai bot**

### Wrap-up code-based ticket closure (Recommended)

To ensure that tickets are closed based on the wrap-up code instead of the "End Conversation" action taken by the agent, add the following conditions into the chat-end event, as shown in the screenshot below.

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/btLbUYX.png)


### Issue arising when not using wrap-up code-based ticket closure

If you're not using wrap-up code-based ticket closure with Genesys, you might encounter issues when an agent ends the conversation by clicking the "End Conversation" button or declines the conversation when prompted. In these cases, we receive the same data from Genesys, which signals our system to end the conversation on the bot for the user. However, we can't distinguish whether the agent is closing the ticket or declining it. This confusion can also occur when an agent transfers the conversation to a queue, and another agent declines the ticket.

We recommend using wrap-up code-based ticket closure for smoother ticket management.
