The Google Play Store integration with Yellow.ai enables businesses to monitor and manage app reviews **directly within the AI Agent**, eliminating the need to switch between platforms. 

By centralizing review management within the bot, businesses can streamline feedback handling, enhance customer engagement, and reduce response time, all without leaving the Yellow.ai platform.

With this integration, the AI Agent can:  

- **Fetch user reviews and ratings**: Automatically retrieve new app reviews and ratings in real time from Google Play Store. This allows teams to track app performance, analyze user sentiment, and respond proactively.  
- **Respond to user reviews**: The AI or Human agent can respond to reviews **from within the platform**. The AI Agent can send automated replies, while low ratings can be escalated to a human agent for personalized engagement.


**Limitation**

* Bot or agent can send only one reply per feedback, with a maximum of 250 characters.

**Prerequisites**

Before proceeding with this integration, ensure you have:

* Google play console access
* Google cloud console access
* An Android app deployed on the Play store

## Enable Google play store event to receive events in bot

To enable Google play store event, follow these steps:

1. On the [Cloud platform](https://cloud.yellow.ai/), go to **Staging** or **Development** environment.

2. On the left navigation bar, click **Automation** > **Event** > **Integrations** and search for `playstore_review`.

## Use cases supported for Google play store integration

1. **Fetch user reviews and ratings**: The bot can automatically fetch new app reviews and ratings from the Google play store. This integration enables real-time retrieval of user feedback. This helps to analyse the user sentiment and track app performance.

2. **Send response to user reviews**: The bot or a live agent can respond to user reviews directly from the platform. When a user submits a review, the bot can send an automated response, or if the rating is low, escalate it to a human agent for personalized engagement. However, each review can receive only one response, with a maximum length of 250 characters.
