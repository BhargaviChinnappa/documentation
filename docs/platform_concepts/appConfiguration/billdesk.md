Yellow.ai Integration with Billdesk UPI Payment Gateway allows you to create UPI Intent for WA Pay, view payment status and Send UPI notification with the yellow.ai platform. 

## Connecting BillDesk to yellow.ai

You can connect your account only in development environment and not in live. For a three-tier environment, you can connect an account in Staging and Sandbox environment. Once the bot is published, it will use the integrations if they are configured in the flows.

2. Upload your Public Key file in some bucket or server like (AWS-S3, SFTP, etc) and Get the public CDN Url . Note:(CDN URL should be public readable).

3. On the [Cloud platform](https://cloud.yellow.ai), navigate to the Development/Staging environment and click **Extensions** > **Integrations** > **Payment** > **BillDesk**. You can also search for the Cashfree app.
