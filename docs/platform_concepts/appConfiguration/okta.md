Your Yellow.ai platform can now be integrated with [Okta](https://www.okta.com/). **Okta** is a customizable, secure, and drop-in solution that adds authentication and authorization services to your applications. Get scalable authentication built right into your application without the development overhead, security risks, and maintenance that come from building it yourself. 

You can connect any application in any language or on any stack to Okta and define how you want your users to sign in. Each time a user tries to authenticate, **Okta** will verify their identity and send the required information back to your app. This integration lets you generate login links and get user details.




## 1. Connect Yellow.ai with Okta

To connect your Okta account with Yellow.ai, follow the steps mentioned below:

### 1.1 Fetch Okta app integration credentials

1. Sign-in to your **Okta** with your Admin account. In the **Admin Console**, go to **Applications** > **Applications**. 
2. If you already have the app integration in your org, you can search for it using the search box. Once you find it, click on it to go to the settings page. [OR] Use **Browse App Catalog** to choose a preconfigured app integration in the **Okta** catalog.

* For Single Sign-On (SAML) apps, the Client ID is not applicable or visible.
:::


3. Once you click the app integration, you will be redirected to the setting page. Here, under the **General** tab, the **Client Credentials** section shows the **Client ID** and **Client secrets** for your app integration.

5. Fill in the fields under **Account Details** and click **Connect**.
6. If you have multiple accounts, follow the above mentioned steps to add each of them.

:::note
1. Enter a unique name for each account to easily identify them within the yellow.ai platform. It is recommended to use a name that aligns with its purpose for better usability. 
2. You can add a maximum of 15 accounts.
3. In a two-tier environment, such as bots with only Development/Live environments, you can add account names only in the development mode. Once added and flows have been built, in the Live mode, you can only choose the account names and not edit them.
4. In a three-tier environment, such as bots with Staging/Sandbox/Production modes, in Staging and Sandbox modes, you can add and edit new accounts. However, in Production, only the account details added in Staging will be available. You can only map in the production environment.

### 1.3 Receive event in Yellow.ai bot

1. In the left navigation, go to **Automation** > **Events**.
2. Click on **Custom Events**.

5. Create an event named **okta-auth-success** and activate it.
6. A journey needs to be created in the Automation module with this event as its trigger point. Based on the received event data, an appropriate message will be displayed to the end user.

| Field name | Sample value | Data type |Description|
| -------- | -------- | -------- |----|
| Redirect URI     | `https://cloud.yellow.ai/integrations/genericIntegration/oauth/okta/x5` | String   | Callback location where the authorization code or tokens should be sent.

5. The **Generate Login URL Integration Action Node** has two outcomes, success or failure. Based on the success/failure of the execution of the **Integration Action Node**, the flow will proceed to success or fallback branches respectively.

**Sample response in case of success:**

```

{
             "success": true,
             "message": "Login URL Generated Successfully.",
