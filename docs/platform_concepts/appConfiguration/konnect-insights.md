1. **Ticket Creation**: Yellow.ai generates tickets in Konnect Insights as soon as a ticket is created in Yellow.ai, sending chat conversations for sentiment analysis, aiding agent understanding.
2. **Agent Conversations**: All agent interactions within Yellow.ai are forwarded to Konnect Insights for comprehensive analysis.
