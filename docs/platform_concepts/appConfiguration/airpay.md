**Pass dynamic data in variables**

From customers you can collect information and fill these fields. Add [prompt nodes](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/prompt-nodes) before the integration node and [store the response of each node in a variable](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/bot-variables#store-data-in-variables). Then, pass those variables in the respective fields here.
