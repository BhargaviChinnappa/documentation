## Set up email automation 


To set up email automation for your email ID, follow these steps:

1. Log in to cloud.yellow.ai and create a bot.
2. **Configure email channel**: 
    - Navigate to **Channels** > **Email** and click on **Add account**. 
    - Under **Configure objective**, select **Email automation** to enable the configuration of your email ID for email automation. 
    - Provide necessary details. 
    - Click **Save**. 

> Refer to [this guide](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/channelConfiguration/email-outbound), to understand email channel configuration.

2. [**Design your bot**](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/get_started/createfirstbot): Customize flows, intents, entities, FAQs, and documents based on your use case to ensure the bot generates responses to customer queries received via email. 

> While creating flows, note that only **Text** and **Action** nodes are supported. 

3. **Test the output**: Once the email is configured, the bot automatically generates responses to any emails received on the configured email ID. Send a test email (initiate a conversation based on the input given to your bot) to test the automated output.
4. **Debug your flow**: Analyze the conversation by looking at it on **Analyze > Conversation logs**. Based on the conversation taking place, fine-tune the bot's ability to comprehend emails and generate accurate responses.
