## 1. Monitor live chat activities

The chat trends tab provides valuable insights into live chat activity and performance metrics, enabling admins/supervisors to monitor trends and optimize chat support operations effectively.



**Use cases of metrics on chat trends**:

| Use case | Description/Solution |
| -------- | -------- |
| **Chat volume trends**     | Admins can track the overall chat volume trends over time. They can monitor the total number of chats assigned, resolved, missed, and queued. This data can be found in the graphs, which provides a deep dive into chat statistics based on different date ranges. |
| **Response time trends** | Monitoring response time trends helps assess the efficiency of agent interactions with customers. Admins can track the average first response time and average reply time to identify any patterns or changes over time. This data is available in **First response time** and **Average reply time** for the last seven days. |
| **Agent performance** | Admins can monitor the performance of individual agents by reviewing metrics such as average handling time and the number of resolved chats. On the widgets you can see average handling time for the last seven days and the total number of resolved tickets.|
| **Customer wait time** | Tracking the average wait time for customers before connecting with a live agent is crucial for optimizing the customer experience. Admins can monitor the average wait time to identify any trends or potential issues. This data can be found in the graph highlighting the average wait time for chats.|
| **Tag based chat analysis** | Admins can utilize the tag filtering option to analyze specific chat tags. By selecting a tag from the dropdown, they can filter chat details and review metrics related to specific topics or categories. This allows admins/supervisors to monitor chat trends and performance based on specific tags assigned during chat creation. |

### Dashboard to monitor live chats 

A live monitor dashboard has been specifically developed for inbox admins and supervisors to oversee latest live chats.

<img src="https://cdn.yellowmessenger.com/assets/yellow-docs/monitorlivechat.png" alt="drawing" width="80%"/>

- The table includes the following information for each chat:
    - **ID**: Unique identification for each chat.
    - **Customer name**
    - **Agent assigned**
    - **Group**
    - **First response timer**: Duration taken by the agent to respond to the initial message from the customer in the chat.
    - **Current response timer**: Duration taken by the agent to respond to the customer's most recent message.
    - **Inactivity status**
    - **Chat duration**

:::note
The first and current response timers continue running (indicated in red) until the agent sends a response. Once the response is sent, the corresponding timestamp will be displayed in the respective row.
:::

- When a new chat is assigned, a new row is appended to the table and marked with the `new` tag for 5 seconds, allowing for easy identification.
