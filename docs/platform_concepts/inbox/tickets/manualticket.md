There are different methods to create email tickets in Inbox. 
- Ideally, an email ticket is created when an end user sends an email to the [configured email address](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/inbox/tickets/setupandconfig) requesting customer support. This email is automatically converted into an email ticket and auto-assigned to a live agent.   
- Alternative method is to create email tickets manually. 


-----

**Manual email ticket creation**

Manual tickets are created by the inbox agents when in scenarios where they are urged to reach out to the customers and provide support/promotions to them through emails. For example:    
- If the customer has contacted the agent/brand via. call/website/tweet, an agent must capture the support request and create a ticket on behalf of the customer.  
- Proactive reach out when the brands have identified potential customers, promotional messages, brand discounts, updates, etc. emails can be sent to the customer for marketing and retention purpose.
