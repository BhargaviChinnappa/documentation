This article explains how to set up inbox configuration to process email tickets without having to write any code.          
Once this configuration is complete, any emails sent to the support email will be converted into tickets and will be available on the **Tickets** page which will be automatically assigned to an inbox agent for resolution.

There are three steps to be followed in the given order: 
1. [Create an email channel (email ID)](#1-set-up-email-channel)
2. [Link  email channel to Inbox (with forwarding address)](#2-set-mail-forwarding)
3. [Enable email ticketing from settings](#3-enable-email-ticketing-settings)



## 1. Set up Email channel  


Configure the email channel from the channels module, follow the below steps:


1. Open **Channels** > **Email**. You can create an email(/account) for your group that handles email tickets. 
2. Select **Basic/Advance** and add **Email server**, **Username**, **Password**, etc.  Click [here](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/channelConfiguration/email-outbound) for detailed documentation.  
3. In **Configuration object** field, select **Support ticketing**.

**Purpose of Forwarding address** 

When any new email is sent to this particular email ID (that was created for support ticketing), the user email will be forwarded to the current Inbox section. 
That is, the emails sent to the email ID will be available on the yellow.ai platform so that the Agent - customer communication can take place in the Inbox Email chat rather than Email chat.
