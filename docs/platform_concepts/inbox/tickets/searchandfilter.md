2. **Message details**: This category enables you to search for specific keywords contained within the email body.

#### Ticket and message details search results 

Upon clicking **See all results**, you will be directed to the results page, where you can choose to view the matches found in either the **Ticket** details or **Message** details.

**Point to remember:**

* Text entered within Search should be less than **50 characters** in total. 
* You can only search for keywords that are **at least 2 characters** long. For instance, typing "t" won't yield any results, while "tes" will.
* Search keywords are **not case-sensitive**, meaning that the search results will be the same regardless of whether the characters are in uppercase or lowercase.
* You can get an **exact match** by using double quotes in your search. 
    * Searching for *test reply* (without quotes) may return results like `test`, `reply`, `test case`, `quick reply`, `this is a test reply`, and more.
    * Searching for *"test reply"* (with quotes) will return only results that contain the exact phrase `test reply`.
