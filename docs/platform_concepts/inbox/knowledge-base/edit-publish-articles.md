When creating support articles, multiple updates and reviews are often necessary before publishing to ensure quality and accuracy. Here's how you can effectively manage, edit, and publish articles in the support portal.

## 1. Publish an article

Follow the given steps to publish new articles to your support portal:  

:::note

- Every newly created article is in **Draft** status by default. When an article is under draft status it will not be visible to the agents or your end-users.
- You can save the article temporarily and keep on making changes until it is ready to go live.

:::

1. Once you are sure that the article can be published, click **Publish** in the top right corner.

2. Select the visibility & the language of the article's content to publish the article.
3. Add relevant tags to the article.               
	- **Tags** are effectively used to group & organize content across your support portal. It helps readers find what they are looking for. They also provide data about your page to search engines and website visitors.
4. Visibility defines to which persona the article is visible:      
    - **Internal**: Only visible to your team i.e agents & admins. Not visible to the end-users.                   
	- **External**: Visible to both your end-users and your team.

3. Properties like Article details and SEO settings in the right side section can be edited independently of the article content.      
4. Clicking on Edit in an already published article, will create a draft version with the same content. This version is independent of the published version that is still live & visible to the end users (If you don't want an article to be visible to the end users, you can either un-publish it or delete the article).        
	- Now the same article has both **draft** and **published** versions of the article.

7. An article can at most have 1 published version & 1 draft version at a time.       
8. When you are opening an article that has both published & draft versions, by default **draft** version would be visible.        
9. If you want to delete the draft version but not the article, click the **discard** draft button inside the article.
