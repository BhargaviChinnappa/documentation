## 1. Custom field in chat/ticket details

**What are custom fields?**

Custom fields can be added to tickets and are used to track business-specific information related to the customer like Order ID, Address, case details, etc. These are customized fields created by the admin to obtain additional details based on the industry. Custom fields enable your teams to add more information and further context about a case, which helps with better reporting and faster resolution. 
- As per the configuration, Custom fields can also be used as mandatory fields to **Resolve/Transfer** a chat/ticket.
- **11 types of Custom fields** are available for both live chats and email tickets.


**Where can you find custom fields?**


- On the [chat screen](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/inbox/chats/chatscreen#-2-user-details), expand **Details**. These are captured and passed to inbox via. **Raise ticket node > Advanced options**.

:::info

Chat custom fields can store any type of data as read-only (agents will not be able to edit the value). For example:
- If a customer's account number is stored as a custom field and must remain unchanged by agents, it can be marked as read-only.
- If CSAT (number type) custom field, set as read-only, the bot populate the data after collecting CSAT from the user, it cannot be updated by the agents. 

When the read-only option is enabled, **Required to close ticket** and **Required to create ticket** settings will be disabled.

Read-only option is not available for email custom fields.

6. Click **Create**. Once these fields are added, they will be listed on the ticket/chat details section on the right sidebar.

#### Re-order custom fields as per their priority

:::info
**Hierarchical custom field (HCF)**

HCF is utilized when dealing with multiple levels of information. For example, when a customer reports *Charging broken*, the agent can retrieve product details (Laptop/Mobile), assign it to a component (Charger), and find a resolution for that specific component.
- You can have only four levels of HCF.
- The option to mark as **Required for ticket creation** is not available for HCF.
- These fields cannot be fetched from the **Raise ticket** node; hence, you cannot mark them as read-only. 
- All fields are marked as mandatory; therefore, all HCFs must be entered.

- All levels of HCFs will be required on the ticket when marked as 'Required for transfer/close.

:::note

If you input a **URL** into **Short/Long text** custom fields, Inbox can automatically recognize it and facilitate one-click navigation for agents, simplifying the process compared to the tedious method where they have to manually select, copy, open a new tab, and paste the URL.
- The URL won't be recognized if it doesn't have "www" in the web address.

## 4. Event to identify custom field inputs

When a custom field is updated in the platform, an event `ticket-update` is triggered, with the `changeType` set as `change_custom_field`. This event can be captured and utilized by activating it in **Automation** on **Events**. 

> For steps to create and activate events, refer to [this article](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/events/event-hub#-8-custom-events).

By identifying the `ticket-update` event and custom fields associated with it, you can develop Automation flows to address various use cases. 
- For example: When you have a custom field called "Order ID" in the Inbox and it gets updated, you can create an automation flow on Automation module that triggers an action to update the corresponding order details on your website.

This can help keep the information synchronized and save time by avoiding the need for manual updates.
