The type of notifications that must be displayed on this tab can be configured from the Notification settings.

8. Click **Save** and save the changes.    

:::note
Notifications are not in real-time, so delays are expected. When a new chat is assigned to an agent, it will be added to the agent's chat list, and a notification sound will play. This will only occur when the user is on the chats page and has configured the permissions.
