## Email templates overview

Email templates are pre built templates that can be sent to the customers directly while creating and responding to the [email tickets](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/inbox/tickets/tickets_intro). 

HTML email branding templates can help support teams (Inbox agents) communicate with customers by: 
- Providing a consistent and professional look and feel for all of the company emails.

When creating a new email template:

1. Enter a relevant **Template Name**.
2. Choose the appropriate **Editor Type** based on your formatting needs.

#### HTML Editor

- The HTML Editor includes boilerplate HTML (`<html>`, `<head>`, `<title>`, and `<body>`) by default.
- Insert the email title within the `<title>` tags.
- Place your content between the `<body>` tags.
- Use dynamic variables like `{{ content }}` for personalization.
- Additional HTML tags such as `<div>`, `<table>`, or `<img>` can be used for layout and design.

#### Plain Text Editor

- This editor is for plain text templates without formatting.
- Supports basic text and dynamic variables.
- Use `{{ content }}` and other supported tokens to personalize the content.


### Step 4: Add dynamic variables

Dynamic variables populate the email with relevant data, such as the agent’s name, bot name, and ticket information.

#### Insert variables

1. Click the **Variables** icon at the top of the template editor.
2. From the list of variables, click **Add** to insert them into your template.

**Example**

| Input | Rendered output|
| -------- | -------- |
| Hi! I'm ``{{agent.name}}`` <br/> Thanks for talking to ``{{bot.botName}}``!| Hi! I'm John.<br/> Thanks for talking to MIA!     |

#### Supported variables


| Variable         | Description                            |
|------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Agent response variables**||
`{{content}}`   | Replaced with the agent's response.     |
| `{{latestEmailContent}}`   | Displays only the most recent reply.    |
| `{{emailHistory}}`  | Includes the full conversation trail.   |
|**Ticket detail variables**||
| `{{ticket.ticketId}}`              | The associated ticket's unique ID.      |
| `{{ticket.subject}}`                | Subject line of the ticket.             |
| `{{agent.username}}`    | Full name of the assigned agent.        |
| `{{assignedAgent.aliasname}}` | Alias name of the assigned agent.   |
| `{{agent.email}}`   | Email address of the assigned agent.    |
| `{{agent.signature}}` | Email signature of the assigned agent. | 
|**Bot detail variables**||
| `{{bot.botName}}`   | Name of the active bot.  |


:::info
**Best practices for using variables**

Avoid including the entire email history in every template to keep the emails concise and readable. Instead, structure your template as follows:

- Start with `{{content}}` to show the agent's latest response.
- Add the agent’s signature.
- Optionally, include `Email history` only in templates that require full context.

### Step 5: Preview and save the template

1. Preview the design for both web and app interfaces.
2. Once satisfied, click **Create template** to save your changes.
