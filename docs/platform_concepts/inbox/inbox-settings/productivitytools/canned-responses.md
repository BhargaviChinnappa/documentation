Canned responses are pre-defined snippets of texts that can be used as shortcuts, greetings, and conversation dialogues while an agent is typing a message. It reduces the time taken by an agent to respond to a chat/ticket. 

You can directly add frequently used content (image/text) in a message without typing it multiple times. For example, questions like 'What is your return policy?' are asked frequently, for such questions, instead of typing the policy, an agent can add a canned response(which will have the policy).

Canned responses can be configured for:
1. **Live chats**- Can have Text and Media as a response
2. **Email tickets**- Can have only Text as a response

Based on the requirement, canned responses can be added or edited by an inbox admin. The process to add/delete canned responses for chat and email is the same.

### Canned response search functionality 

You can search for canned responses in the dropdown list by clicking on the canned response icon and entering relevant tags/content. Here are some tips on how to use the canned response search effectively:
- **Search by tag or content**: Canned responses can be searched using either tags or the exact words within their content.     
    > If you have a canned response tagged as "greeting" and the content "Hello, how can I assist you?", searching for either "greeting" or "assist" will display this response.
    
    **Tag search**:

    **Content search**:

- **Highlighting of matching terms**: When you perform a search, the matching content or tag from the search term will be highlighted in bold. This makes it easier to identify relevant responses. 
    > If you search for the tag "discount," any canned responses with that tag will have it highlighted.

- **Preference for tag results**: Results that match the assigned tags will be given priority over those that match the content. 
    > If you have a canned response tag as "billing" and another response with the word "billing" in its content, the tag "billing" will appear first in the search results.
- **Case insensitivity**: The search function is case insensitive, meaning it considers uppercase and lowercase letters as equivalent. 
    > Searching for "Fashion" or "fashion" will yield the same results.

- **Combined result for multiple search terms**: When you use multiple search terms, the results will only be shown if both terms match in the exact order. 
    > Searching for "fanta" and "offers" will only display responses that contain both of these words in that specific order.


:::note
Media type canned responses can only be searched through their assigned tags and not their attachment names.
