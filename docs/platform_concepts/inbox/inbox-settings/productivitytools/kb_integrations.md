3rd party Integrations are a means to facilitate the support portal with additional capabilities like live chat, tracking customers, and their behavioral data, commenting, etc. These integrations will help you make use of the best tool available to boost the functionality of the current system and share data to get a 360 degree of the end-user journey and their interactions.        
**Example**:        
By adding Google analytics to your GTM and integrating it with your support portal, you can track data for the total page visits, time spent by the user on each of the pages along with their demographic data, event-driven analytics, ability to comment, and perform A/B testing.

Currently Chat bot integration and Google tag manager integration are enabled.

> There can be only one chatbot and one support portal integration active at any point in time. They can be connected/disconnected as and when required.

##  1. Integrate support portal with chat bots(widgets)

To connect a chat bot, follow the below steps:

    ![](https://i.imgur.com/bCwI1Ms.png)       
5. Add bot code.     
    - If you want to connect a bot built on any third-party platform, *copy* the chatbot code (without script tags) and *paste* it in the **Bot widget code** box. 
    - To connect your support portal with the bot built on the yellow platform, click **Insert bot code**.   
    (Refer to [Deploy chat widget](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/channelConfiguration/web-widget#24-deploy-chat-widget), to fetch bot code from **Channels**)

![](https://i.imgur.com/dqmVgrb.png)

**Sample code** (copy/paste only the content available within script tags): 

```
    window.ymConfig = {"bot":"x1609156756707","host":"https://cloud.yellow.ai"};(function () {var w=window,ic=w.YellowMessenger;if("function"===typeof ic)ic("reattach_activator"),ic("update",ymConfig);else{var d=document,i=function(){i.c(arguments)};function l(){var e=d.createElement("script");e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.src="https://cdn.yellowmessenger.com/plugin/widget-v2/latest/dist/main.min.js";var t=d.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)}i.q=[],i.c=function(e){i.q.push(e)},w.YellowMessenger=i,w.attachEvent?w.attachEvent("onload",l):w.addEventListener("load",l,!1)}})();
```

6. Manually verify if the entered code is correct. Click **Connect**.

##  2. Integrate KB with google tag manager(GTM)


Google Tag Manager(GTM) is a tag management system where you can quickly and easily update measurement codes and their related code fragments collectively known as **Tags** on your website or mobile app.
Instead of integrating and monitoring tracking code for tools like Google Analytics, Facebook pixel tracking, Google Ads, etc, you can create one GTM tag and monitor all the required tools in one place.  

Google Tag Manager will be an intermediate between your support portal and the tools(tags) you want to integrate. 


> See the tag template types(tools) that are natively supported by Google Tag Manager [here](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6106924?hl=en). 

--------

To integrate GTM with your support portal, follow the steps below: 

1. Create a [GTM account](https://tagmanager.google.com/#/home). Configure all the tools (required for your KB) like Google Analytics, Google Ads, Facebook pixel tracking, etc. in your GTM account.          
2. Copy the **GTM ID**/ Tag tracking code from your GTM account (found on the top bar).
