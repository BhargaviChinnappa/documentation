<details>
 <summary>How many messages can one email ticket have?</summary>
 <div>

An email ticket has a limitation of displaying up to **100 email replies** in a thread.  
In Outlook, email tickets do not appear as a thread; instead, each reply is treated as a new email. Users can also change the subject.

</div>
</details>

<details>
 <summary>How does the notification icon/feature work for admins or agents? Is it a real-time alert?</summary>
 <div>
 
- **For agents in the Inbox (Chat section):** They receive messages in real-time.  <br/> - **For agents in the Inbox but outside the Chat section:** They receive real-time notifications with a sound alert, ensuring they are promptly notified of new messages.  <br/> - **For agents logging in with unread notifications:** The bell icon highlights missed notifications, helping them catch up on past messages. <br/><br/> Since its primary function is to indicate unread messages upon login rather than act as a real-time alert system, updating it live is unnecessary.  

</div>
</details>


<details>
<summary> 
Can we have primary and secondary WhatsApp numbers(2 phone numbers) connecting a bot user to the live agents? </summary>
<div>
Each bot has only one inbox, the bot can have multiple Whatsapp numbers activated, and the agent queries will be directed to the bot's Inbox. Hence, all Whatsapp numbers are sourced to the same Inbox module, and agents will be assigned with live chats from any of the numbers.
</div>
</details>
    
<details>
  <summary>Is it necessary to publish after setting new working hours?</summary>
  <div>
    No, it is not necessary to publish after setting new working hours. You can simply save the changes, as these settings are related to the inbox and not specific to bot building.
  </div>
</details>

    
<details>
<summary> Why is the agent's language not getting translated automatically to the customer's language even when the agent is replying in English?
</summary>
<div>
    
You can set the default language of the agent to English in <b>Inbox</b> > <b>Settings</b> > <b>Team</b> > <b>Agents</b>. Open the agent profile and select the <b>Default Language</b>.

<summary> How can I delete my chat and email tickets? </summary>
<div>

</div>
</details>


<details>
<summary> When an inbox agent role is logged in, the user can view all the chats in the Missed Chats section and also in the Bot Messages section which are not assigned to him. Is this expected behavior? </summary>

Yes, this is expected behavior. Missed chats are not assigned to any particular agent, which is why all missed chats are visible to agents. This allows agents to reopen and assign the chats to themselves.
</details>

<details>
<summary> Is it possible for an inbox agent role to view only the chats that are assigned to him in Missed Chats and Bot Messages sections? Or is there a way to disable these sections for a particular user?
</summary>

If you need to disable the Missed Chats or Bot Messages sections for a particular user, please raise a ticket with customer context to request this configuration change.
</details>

<details>
<summary>When an inbox agent with the supervisor role is logged in, the user can view all the chats in the Resolved Chats section. Is this expected behavior?
</summary>

Yes, this is expected behavior. When someone is made an Inbox supervisor for particular group(s), they will see all the chats raised in those group(s).
</details>

<details>
<summary>Is it possible for an inbox agent with the supervisor role to view only the chats that are assigned to him and his team members within the group?</summary>

If a supervisor is seeing chats from groups to which they were not assigned, this is a bug. Please raise this issue in DevRev for further investigation.
</details>

<details>

<div>

</div>
</details>



<details>
  <summary>Why can't I view recent activity on my contact card?</summary>
  <div>
    If you only see the View contact link in the UI, it is likely due to incorrect configuration of user360 variables. Ensure that you have set up flows to fetch the first name and either the mobile number or email values, storing them in user property variables. Make sure to use only these variables in the Raise Ticket node for proper functionality.
  </div>
</details>



<details>
<summary> What is the chat history retention policy? </summary>
  <div>
    Live chats and email tickets in the Inbox are retained for a maximum of 6 months. After this period, they will be archived. While the data will no longer be accessible on the platform (active store), it will still be available on the servers (cold store) until the contract's validity expires.
  </div>
</details>


<details>
<summary> Can the SLA policy change for a ticket once a policy is applied? </summary>
  <div>
Yes, the SLA policy can change for a ticket once a policy is applied. If the priority of the ticket is changed, the SLA will also change based on the new priority. However, the first SLA policy that gets applied to a ticket will not change if the Group/Tag is changed because SLAs are end-customer facing. Additionally, breaches of the initial SLA policy will be recorded and will be present as part of reports, but they will not be back-dated.
  </div>
</details>


<details>
<summary> Can the SLA policy get applied to a ticket after a tag is added? </summary>
  <div>
  No, the first SLA policy that gets applied to a ticket will not change if the Group/Tag is changed because SLAs are end-customer facing.
  </div>
</details>      


#### **Sticky agents** 

<details>
<summary> What does "agents not eligible to take chats" mean? </summary>
<div>
Agents are considered to be not eligible for assignment when the agent status is currently offline/busy/away and when the agent has no vacant concurrency to assign chats.
</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary> Will a sticky ticket go into the queue if it is raised when all my agents are occupied? </summary>
<div>
Sticky tickets will not go into the queue even if the group queue is turned ON. When an agent is at maximum concurrency OR busy/away/offline they are considered to be not eligible and will be skipped in consideration. It is recommended to a higher number than the set chat concurrency.
</div>
</details>


#### **WhatsApp policy**   


<details>
<summary> What is the cost of sending WhatsApp templates? </summary>
<div>

</div>
</details>


<details>
<summary> Why is my chatbox not visible even though I have sent the WA template? </summary>

<b> Image </b> - Jpeg or png format not more than 5MB, <b> Video </b> - MP4 video not more than 16MB, <b> Document </b> - PDF.  
</div>
</details>


<details>
<summary> Why am I not able to see any templates? </summary>
<div>
There are two reasons why you are not able to see any WhatsApp templates within your  Inbox:  None of your templates are approved by WhatsApp yet or you have not created any templates yet.  
</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary> Why am I not able to see the template message content that I just sent? </summary>
<div>
WhatsApp templates created with <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/updates-to-pricing/">hsm</a>  object will not be displayed with the actual content inside Inbox. However templates created with <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/updates-to-pricing/"> template </a> object will be displayed inside Inbox. If you are not seeing the actual template content, then the template you sent out is most likely created with hsm object.

#### **Instagram policy**

<details>
<summary> What is Instagram 7-day policy? </summary>
<div>
Instagram's 7-day policy for live chats refers to the limitation on replying to Direct Messages (DMs) after a certain period of inactivity. This policy aims to promote timely customer service and prevent brands or individuals from sending unsolicited messages or promotional content after a prolonged silence. <br/> <br/> Breakdown of the 7-day policy: <br/> - <b> Initial 24 hours </b> : You can freely respond to DMs without any restrictions, including sending promotional content or using automated bot replies. <br/> - <b> After 24 hours but within 7 days </b> : Your responses must be directly related to the topic of the conversation. Promotional content or automated bot replies are not allowed. <br/> - <b> After 7 days </b> : You can only send one of three types of responses, that is, request the user to restart the conversation to initiate a new 7-day window, provide a link to your Instagram profile or website for further information, or ask the user to contact you through another channel, such as email or phone.
