Automation is an AI-agent building platform that allows you to easily build and customize AI-agent conversations without requiring coding expertise. It provides all the necessary tools to create and test conversational AI-agents.


<!-- #### Key features of Automation:

* **Easy conversational flow design**: Easily design the flow of interactions between your AI-agent and customers using intuitive Automation tools like start triggers, [nodes](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes), variables, fallbacks, databases, and functions.
* **Natural Language Processing (NLP) training**: Train your AI-agent with specific intents to trigger the respective flow to respond accurately to user queries.
* **Custom logic implementation**: Implement advanced functionalities such as multilingual communication, API integrations with third-party apps, and database management using custom logic.
* **Conversation logs**: Keep track of the interaction history between users and your AI-agent, allowing you to analyze interactions and identify potential conversation issues.
* **Instant answering AI-agent creation**: Quickly create a AI-agent designed to provide instant answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs). Easily upload offline documents or add website URLs to enrich your AI-agent's knowledge base. With AI-enabled features, it can perform search operations and provide summarized results to user queries.
* **API integration**: Seamlessly integrate third-party APIs that cannot be integrated through the standard integration module. This feature allows you to enhance the functionality of your FAQ AI-agent by accessing external data and services.

<!-- ## Create your first AI-agent    

Creating a high-performing AI agent involves configuring its personality, capabilities, and interaction channels—including voice. This guide gives you a one-glance understanding of the core setup areas needed to deliver seamless, intelligent user experiences across text and speech.

> ✅ Whether you are building an agent for chat, voice AI, or multi-turn automation, this setup ensures every interaction aligns with your brand, meets user expectations, and scales effortlessly.

## Configuration at a glance

1. **Start with the Super Agent**: Define high-level agent identity and behavior defaults.
2. **Add an Agent**: Configure specific use cases your bot will handle.
3. **Design Conversations**: Use prompts, actions, and logic to shape user interactions.
4. **Set Up Voice AI**: Fine-tune speech capabilities for natural, spoken dialogue.
5. **Manage Variables**: Keep conversation context with reusable, testable variables.
6. **Test and Go Live**: Validate behavior in dev, then publish to production safely.

Here’s what you will find and can customize in every part of the AI agent setup.


| Configuration Area       | Purpose                                                 | What You Define                                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AI Agent Profile**     | Establishes the agent’s identity and scope.             | Name, role, supported region, model, and data policies.                           |
| **Persona & Tone**       | Shapes the agent’s personality and communication style. | Welcome message, fallback handling, tone, and brand voice alignment.              |
