Adding FAQs to the AI-agent improves user experience by providing self-service support to users to find answers to their questions. FAQs are trained to recognize various forms of questions to understand natural language and respond to user inquiries.

FAQs can used to assist users with common queries and provide answers to frequently asked questions in messaging platforms, mobile apps to provide 24/7 customer support, and websites to improve user engagement.

**Key features of FAQ AI-agents:**

* **Question recognition**: FAQ are trained to recognize various forms of questions, allowing users to ask questions in natural language rather than using specific commands.
* **Self-service support**: FAQ offer self-service support by enabling users to find answers to their questions
* **Response generation**: FAQ AI-agents generate responses based on the question that is trained. Responses can include text, links, images, or other multimedia elements to provide answers to user queries.
