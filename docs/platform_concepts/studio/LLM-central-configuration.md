LLM (Large Language Model) configuration allows you to centrally manage LLM models and accounts for all LLM-powered features, such as the Dynamic chat node, Conversations, Agent AI, and Knowledge Base (KB).

This centralized setup allows you to use different accounts and configurations for various LLM modules based on your requirements and eliminates the need for repeated configurations.

#### Capabilities of LLM configuration

With LLM configuration, you can:

* Create, edit, switch models, and disconnect LLM accounts.
* Associate LLM accounts at the environment level:
  * Two tier environment - Develpoment and Live
  * Three tier environment - Sandbox, Staging, and Production

The Yellow account is preconfigured with **Gpt 4o mini** account and enabled across all environments by default. The Knowledge Base (KB) uses our proprietary in-house model by default, but you can switch to a different model if needed.

### Access LMM configuration

You can access the LLM configuration in two ways:

#### **From the Settings section**
