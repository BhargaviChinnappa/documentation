Logs in AI-agent conversations are step-by-step records, detailing events and flows at the backend, important for identifying errors, understanding user interactions, and optimizing performance. They assist in diagnostics, illustrate user flows, and are crucial for testing and continuous development improvements.

The logs are accessible in real-time for **Sandbox** and **Staging** directly from the ongoing conversation. For **Production**, it will be available 15 minutes after the conversation ends.

:::note
In rare instances, some logs may not be displayed due to our sampling process. This is designed to enhance overall system performance without compromising the quality of the insights provided. If you need a complete log history, please contact our support team for further assistance.
