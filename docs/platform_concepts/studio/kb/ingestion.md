A Knowledge Base (KB) allows your AI agent to retrieve accurate, context-aware responses by accessing organizational content from sources like sitemaps, specific URLs, uploaded documents, or third-party platforms such as ServiceNow.

This setup enables your AI agent to respond to queries using existing help center articles, policy documents, product manuals, and other structured knowledge assets.

**Configure a Knowledge base agent when** :

* Your AI agent needs to respond using detailed references such as help center articles, user manuals, or policy documents.
* You already maintain structured content on websites, in document files (PDF, DOCX, CSV, TXT), or third-party platforms.
* You manage knowledge through platforms like ServiceNow and want to surface those articles within AI conversations.

## Create your Knowledge base agent

:::note
* Only **Admin** or **Developer** can create or configure Knowledge base.
:::

To create a knowledge base agent, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Knowledge base** > **Files**.

## Add content sources to your Knowledge base

You can add content to the Knowledge base using any of the following sources:
 
* [Sitemaps or URLs](#add-sitemap-or-urls-to-your-knowledge-base): This source allows you to add content directly from your website by either uploading a sitemap or entering specific URLs. It is  useful for importing structured information from documentation sites, support portals, or help centers.
     * **Sitemaps**: A sitemap is a XML file that lists all the important pages of a website. 
       * It usually ends in .xml (example, https://example.com/sitemap.xml)
       * It helps fetch content from multiple web pages at once.
       * It is used for adding content from large websites or documentation portals.
     * **URL**: A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is the web address of a specific page on your site. Example: `https://example.com/help/article1`
        * Use this option if you want to add only specific web pages to your Knowledge base
        * Useful when your site does not have a sitemap or you want to include select pages only.

* [Upload files](#upload-documents-to-your-knowledge-base): Upload documents directly (PDF, DOCX, TXT, CSV) to add the content to Knowledge base. 
* [ServiceNow articles](#import-documentation-from-servicenow): Connect your ServiceNow account to automatically sync and retrieve knowledge articles from the ServiceNow platform.

   1. **Contains**
   Excludes any URL that contains the keyword or phrase you enter.
   **Example:** If you enter `?sessionid=`, it will exclude URLs like `www.site.com/page?sessionid=123`.

   2. **Begins with**
   Excludes all URLs that start with the prefix you specify.
   **Example:** If you enter `https://dev.example.com/`, it will exclude every page under that path.

   3. **Equals to**
   Excludes only the URL that exactly matches the value you provide.
   **Example:** If you enter `https://example.com/old_page.html`, only that exact page will be excluded.

6. Click **Done** to complete the setup.
    
#### Import content using URL

You can add website content to your Knowledge base by providing specific URLs. The system uses a crawling method to automatically scan web pages and extract relevant information.
    
1. In **Choose upload type**, select **URL** and click **Next**.

      <img src="https://cdn.yellowmessenger.com/assets/yellow-docs/urlupload.png" alt="drawing" width="80%"/>

2. In **Crawling method**, select the following options:

     <img src="https://cdn.yellowmessenger.com/assets/yellow-docs/crawl.png" alt="drawing" width="80%"/>
     <br/>

     
     1. **All pages**

      The **All pages** option allows the system to crawl and extract content from all the web pages of the specified domain. This is most suitable if your website contains a large set of interlinked pages that you want to make searchable within the AI agent. Note that, your website has well-structured internal links so the system can effectively crawl to all pages.
          
      **Use case**: Best suited for documentation sites, help centers, or blogs where all pages are accessible through internal links.

      **Example**: If you enter https://docs.yellow.ai, the crawler will scan and collect content from every page linked under that domain.
      
        **To add all pages option, follow below steps:**  
        1. Enter your Website URL and click **Next**.
        
        <img src="https://cdn.yellowmessenger.com/assets/yellow-docs/allpages.png" alt="drawing" width="80%"/>
        
        2. To exclude specific URLs from being crawled, turn on the toggle and choose a filter type:

            i. **Contains**: This option will exclude any URL that contains the specified keyword or phrase. Example: Entering ?sessionid= excludes URLs like www.site.com/page?sessionid=123.<br/>
            ii. **Begins with**: This option will exclude all URLs that start with the specified prefix. Example: Entering `https://dev.example.com/` excludes all pages starting with that path.<br/>
            iii. **Equals to:** This option will exclude only the URL that exactly matches the specified text. Example: Entering `https://example.com/old_page.html` excludes only that exact page.

        5. Click **Done** to complete the setup.
        
   ii. **Specific pages**
   
      The Specific pages option crawls only to the URLs you manually enter. This is recommended when you want to include only a few targeted pages or avoid crawling the entire site.

      **Use case**: Useful for privacy policies, single-product pages, FAQs, or any specific page that contains useful standalone information.

    **Example**: If you enter `https://yellow.ai/terms-and-conditions`, only that single page will be crawled and added to the Knowledge Base.

    To add specific pages, follow these steps:

    1. In **Pages to sync**, enter the specific **URL**.

        <img src="https://cdn.yellowmessenger.com/assets/yellow-docs/specificpages.png" alt="drawing" width="80%"/>

## Schedule sync for imports based on URL, Sitemap and ServiceNow

Scheduler helps to keep your knowledge base up to date by automatically syncing content from connected sources.

You can set different sync schedules for each source type—Sitemap, URLs, or ServiceNow integration.

You can configure scheduler at two stages:

1. During data source onboarding
2. From the file management section

#### Set scheduler during onboarding

When adding a new data source like Sitemap, URL, or ServiceNow, you will go through a guided setup flow. One of the final steps in this flow allows you to configure your sync schedule.

To set the scheduler, follow these steps:

1. Choose your data source: Sitemap, URL, or ServiceNow. For more information, refer to [Setup Knowledge base data source](#).

   ![image](https://cdn.yellowmessenger.com/assets/yellow-docs/KBonboarding.png)
   
2. Complete the onboarding steps:
     i. Choose upload type
     ii. Upload URL
     iii. Select content location
     iv. Proceed to the Schedule Sync step     
      <img src="https://cdn.yellowmessenger.com/assets/yellow-docs/scedulesybcstep.png" alt="drawing" width="80%"/>

3. At the Schedule Sync step, select the following frequency and time:
    Frequency | Time
    ----------|------
    Hourly | 1, 3, 6, 12 hour
    Daily |  12 AM to 11 PM
    Weekly | Select Day (Sunday to saturday) and time from 12 AM to 11 PM
    
    <img src="https://cdn.yellowmessenger.com/assets/yellow-docs/setsync.png" alt="drawing" width="80%"/>
    
4. Click **Done**.

* You can also skip this step during onboarding and set or update the sync schedule later from the File Management section.

   
#### Set or modify scheduler from file management

Once the source has been onboarded, you can update the scheduler settings from the **Files & folders** section.

In the scheduler panel, you can:
* Enable or disable automatic sync
* Change the sync frequency and time
* Manage scheduler settings separately for Sitemap, URLs, and Integrations

To access and configure the scheduler:

1. Click the **Scheduler icon** located at the top-right corner of the File management screen.
  
     ![](https://cdn.yellowmessenger.com/assets/yellow-docs/schedulerset.png)
     
2. Enable the toogle button corresponding to the Sitemaps, URL, or Intrgrations for which you want to schedule.
