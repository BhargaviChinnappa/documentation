Date node allows you to select a date or time through an interactive calendar widget within a conversation. When you select a date using the picker, the system validates the input. If the date or time is invalid, a custom validation failure message is displayed. This node is used to get the accurate date or time inputs to reduce the chances of errors in manual input.

Date node is used for:
* **Appointment booking**: Used for scheduling meetings, consultations, or services by selecting a specific date and time.
* **Event registration**: When you need to select event dates or attendance during sign-ups.
* **Form completion**: Collects date inputs for applications, travel itinerarie dates, or scheduling.

#### [Storing date variables](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/bot-variables#41-store-variables)

When a user enters or selects a date, the input undergoes validation and is stored in the specified variable as an object. Users are not limited to using only the date picker; they can also input the date manually, which will still be saved in the variable.

After validating, the system will store the date entered date by users in the specified object variable.

The structure of the date object is as follows:

<Tabs class="tabs-schema">


<TabItem value="singleDatePicker" label="singleDatePicker" default>


To retrieve date from the date object, use this syntax: `{{{variables.variable_name.objectname.field}}}`. For example, to retrieve day from the following object, use `{{{variables.variable_name.value.day}}}`.

```json
{
  "value": {
    "timestamp": "Tue, 12 Dec 2023 13:03:31 GMT",
    "year": 2023,
