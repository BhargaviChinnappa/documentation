Multi-select node allows users to choose multiple options from a predefined list during a single interaction. For example, in a food delivery chatbot, users might select multiple toppings for a pizza or several dishes for an order. Similarly, in a survey bot, they could pick multiple interests like "Technology", "Travel", and "Health".

This node makes it ideal for scenarios like shopping carts, preferences, or bulk actions in workflows.

   * **Button value**: Set a value for each button, which can be stored in a variable or inserted to the database.
   * **Text aliases**:  Define alternative phrases or abbreviations that users might type in place of the button text. For example, if the button text is "number," add aliases like "num" or "no" so the AI-agent can recognize these inputs
   * **Analytics**: Configure any analytics tracking for this node to gather insights on button selections and user interactions.
   * **Prefix image**: Add an image URL to display an icon before the button text if needed.
