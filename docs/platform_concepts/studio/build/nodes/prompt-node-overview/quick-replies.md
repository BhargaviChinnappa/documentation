Quick replies node allows you to display the message to users along with predefined response options in the form of buttons. You can respond by either clicking one of the buttons or typing the choice manually.

You can connect each quick replies to a specific flow to trigger the flow when this button is clicked. Additionally, you can configure a fallback response to handle cases where the user's input doesn't match any of  the provided options.

### Configure Dynamic quick replies

Dynamic quick replies are used to present options generated in real-time based on data fetched from external sources, such as APIs or databases. This is useful in scenarios:
* When the available choices depend on live or updated data, such as product availability, current offers, or real-time status updates.
* When the number of options cannot be predetermined and varies dynamically.
* To avoid manually configuring buttons every time for changing data.

**Example use case:**

* **E-commerce**: Fetch product categories based on user interest or location from an API and display them as quick replies buttons.
* **Travel booking**: Display travel options (for example, flights, hotels) dynamically based on the user's selected destination and dates.

To configure the dynamic quick replies, follow these steps:

1. In the **Quick replies** node, click the highlighted icon to copy the sample quick replies object variable.
