Feedback node allows you to collect feedback during conversations. It allows the AI-agent to prompt users for their ratings, opinions, or suggestions regarding a product, service, or the overall interaction with the AI-agent.

Feedback node is used to capture various types of feedback, such as star ratings, thumbs up or thumbs down, additional comments in a text field on services, products, or the AI-agent itself.
