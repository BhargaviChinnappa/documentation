A voice input node is used to gather user information, process it, and manage various scenarios of conversing in a human-like manner. This node is in auto-sync with the conversation design so all the designs you add there will appear here automatically. To learn about using this node, click [here](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/cookbooks/voice-as-channel/build/usingvoiceinput).

:::note
Voice input node will work only for voice AI-agents, i.e you should have enabled **Voice bot** while creating your AI-agent.
