Email node captures and validates a userâ€™s email address during a conversation. Use this node when the AI-agent needs contact information for follow-ups, registrations, or verifications.  

The built-in validator checks if the email format is correct (`example@domain.com`) before proceeding to the next step. If the user provides an incorrectly formatted email, the AI-agent prompts them to re-enter it, ensuring the information collected is accurate and usable.

**Supported input types**

|Input Type|User Input|Accepted/Not Accepted as a valid email address|Email address processed by the platform|
