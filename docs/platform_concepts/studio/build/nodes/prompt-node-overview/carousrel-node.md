Carousel node is used to display a series of interactive cards with images, titles, descriptions, and buttons. It helps to display the multiple options or the information in a visually appealing and organized format for showcasing products, services, or other interactive content.

Carousel node is used to showcase products or services with details like images, titles, and descriptions to guide users with actionable buttons for navigation or performing specific actions. For example, on a travel website, a carousel node can be used to showcase destinations with images and descriptions. Users can scroll through the cards and use buttons to perform actions like selecting travel dates or exploring package details.
