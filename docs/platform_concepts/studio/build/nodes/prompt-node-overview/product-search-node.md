Harnessing generative AI, the product search node dynamically showcases items from a catalog, enabling personalized interactions based on user choices. Upon selecting a product, it presents related products, optimizing user engagement and facilitating seamless exploration of offerings. 

To use this node, you need to create a [product catalogue](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/product-catalogue) and [configure this node in flows](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/product-catalogue#display-product-catalogue-in-bot-conversations).
