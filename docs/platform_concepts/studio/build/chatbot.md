### Overview: Traditional Chatbots and Workflow Automation

**Traditional chatbots** are built using rule-based flows, where conversations are designed manually through a series of steps, conditions, and logic. These bots rely on predefined **workflows and nodes** to handle user inputs and guide them through structured paths.

* **Workflows** automate backend processes like API calls, database operations, or third-party integrationsâ€”triggered by user actions within the chat.
* **Flows and nodes** form the conversational logic, allowing bot builders to define conditions, responses, and decision points in a visual, step-by-step format.

While this method offers precision and control, it often requires more manual setup and maintenance. It remains widely used across enterprises for its reliability and customization, especially in use cases with well-defined rules and processes.
