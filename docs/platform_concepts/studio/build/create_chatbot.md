## Orchestrator bot

The Orchestrator bot enables you to manage and coordinate multiple bots or conversational flows within a single parent bot. It acts as a controller, guiding users to the appropriate bot or flow based on their queries or context.

The Orchestrator bot allows creating a parent bot and adding multiple child bots under the same subscription and region.

Key features of Orchestrator bot:

* **Centralized management**: Orchestrator bot provides a single platform to manage multiple child bots or conversational flows.
* **Modularity**: Facilitates independent development of child bots by separate teams, promoting flexibility in bot development.
* **Automation**:  It facilitates the automated handling of various use cases such as answering common queries, collecting information from users, and initiating predefined actions without human involvement.


Following are the use cases of Orchestrator bot:

1. **Unified communication for large organizations**: Large organizations often need a central bot (parent bot) through which users can communicate with various child bots based on their needs. For example, an organization with multiple departments can have separate child bots for each department. The orchestrator bot understands user queries and directs them to the appropriate child bot.
2. **Centralized customer support**: When organizations have a live agent team for resolving customer queries, they need a central system to manage and address user needs. For instance, in a customer support scenario, the orchestrator bot can route users to a sales bot if they are interested in purchasing a product or to a technical support bot if they are facing issues with a product.

#### Set a child bot as a default flow

When you set any child bot as the default flow, the orchestrator bot will automatically trigger the default child bot when it loads on the website. At a time, only one child bot can be marked as the default.

To set a child bot as a default flow, follow these steps:

1. Go to the child bot, click on the **more options** icon and select **Mark as default bot**.

1. Go to the child bot and click on the **more-options** icon > **Delete**.

* This will remove the child bot from the parent bot.

### Configure Inbox for Orchestrator bot 

This is where you manage all the customer queries. By selecting the **Unify inbox to all child bots** option, support tickets received by the child bots are consolidated and made accessible in the parent bot's Inbox. This unified inbox streamlines the process of managing and responding to all customer queries.
