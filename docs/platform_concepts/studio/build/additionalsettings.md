Under the Conversation settings, you can access and modify these AI-agent level settings:

### User identification setting

The User identification flow in AI-agent conversations involves identifying the user engaging with the AI-agent. This is accomplished by prompting the user identifier flow for unidentified users even before starting the conversation, which may include an email address, phone number, or other unique information.

To know more about setting up User identification flow in detail, click [here](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/cdp/user_data/userid-flow) 

### Language settings

Add supported languages to your AI-agent to enable communication in multiple languages. This allows you to reach to a wider audience.

### Suggestion setting when AI-agent does not understand user utterance   
   
AI-agent suggestions are automated prompts or recommendations provided by the AI-agent to assist users during a conversation. These suggestions are based on the context of the conversation and can include options for actions, responses, or next steps that the user can take. This helps the users guide through the conversation and facilitate smoother interactions with the AI-agent.

### Document search

The document search enables the AI-agent to search for answers from the website or the documents uploaded in the KB module to provide accurate and relevant responses to user queries. 

It is triggered when the AI-agent is not able to predict a relevant flow.
