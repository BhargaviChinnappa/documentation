## Workflows overview 

The Workflows module enables automation of any routine tasks in your team customer support workflow such as managing Helpdesk activities for support agents, scheduling cron jobs for data teams etc., These workflows function independently from the core AI Agent flow, operating in the background supplementing its operations seamlessly. This streamlines the management of routine tasks, allowing the team to focus on more complex and high-priority issues, improving overall efficiency and productivity.

:::note
Currently, Workflows are supported only for Helpdesk use cases.
:::

### Helpdesk specific examples for Workflows

* Send ticket details to the CRM when an agent closes a ticket.
* Automatically acknowledge the customer after ticket creation.
* Send the full chat transcript including the URL to the CRM.
* Trigger an API call to populate custom fields (5-8) when an agent fills one custom field.
* Add the journey name as a tag to a chat if the customer has gone through a specific journey before raising the chat, aiding both agent reference and support analysis.

### Flows vs Workflows 


| Flows | Workflows |
| -------- | -------- |
|  <ul><li> Flows are created to take input from customers, interpret it, and respond with an appropriate output to resolve customer queries in AI-agent conversations.  </li><li>  Flows involve connecting different triggers and actions to understand customer inputs and provide outputs.   </li></ul>  Check out [detailed documentation on flows](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/Flows/flows-overview)  | <ul><li> Workflows are simplified, **static flows** that run automatically when specific actions or events occur. </li><li> They operate in the **background** and do not require direct interaction with the customer. </li><li> No need to manually enable specific **events**; the selected workflow handles everything automatically. </li><li> The **context** of a workflow lasts only for the selected period and does not extend beyond that. </li> <li> Workflows enhance the AI-agent's functionality by performing tasks such as calling functions, executing APIs, and conducting database operations.</li><li>Workflows can be linked to specific categories and invoked as needed within a conversation.  </li></ul> |

## Set up workflows 

Follow these steps to use a work flow in your AI-agent: 

### Step 1: Open Automation

1. Open **Automation > Build > workflows**. 

   ![image](https://imgur.com/CJjCKrV.png)

2. Click Create **workflow**. 
   
   ![image](https://imgur.com/jBtXRCr.png)

-------

### Step 2: Choose when to trigger the workflow

Choose how your workflow will start by selecting the event/trigger that will initiate the workflow. Once selected, this trigger will automatically serve as the starting point for the flow.


You can select a condition within a start trigger to simplify data extraction and eliminate the need for a separate condition node. Types of conditions can be chat properties such as Tag, Priority, or Custom fields or time. 


Following Workflow can be triggered: 

1. [When a new chat is created](#new-chat-created)
2. [When a chat property is updated](#chat-property-updated)
3. [When an internal note is added](#internal-note)
4. [When chat status is updated](#chat-status-updated)
5. [When chat is transferred](#chat-transferred)
6. [When a customer is inactive in a chat](#customer-inactive)
7. [When an agent is inactive in a chat](#agent-inactive)

:::info

- You can select Minutes from 3, 5, 10, 15, 30, or 45 minutes, Hours from 1 to 23 hours and Days from 1 to 30 days.
- All these time values are in calendar minutes/hours/days and does not follow any business or working hour logic.
- The maximum limit in time bound workflows is 1 month / 720 hours / 30 days. I.e one can’t select a condition like Hours since created is 750 hrs

:::

-------------------

### Step 3: Add a condition node.

You connect the start trigger (first node) to a condition node to add additional conditions that are not available within the start trigger itself. Use **Condition** node to add conditions following the trigger. Condition node has: 

#### If/Else-if

Add multiple Else-if conditions to filter conditions for variables such as **Live chat properties** (Ticket ID, Description, Source/Channel, Status, Priority, Group Name, Agent Name, Internal Note, Tag, number of agent replies and number of user replies) and **User properties**.  

![image](https://imgur.com/lspxKBY.png)


#### Auto populated properties

Based on the selected trigger, all live chat properties are automatically fetched by this node. For example, within the Condition node, you can add a variable by selecting from a dropdown that automatically populates all relevant live chat variables. Simply choose the one that fits your use case.

| **User Event**               | Trigger a user event for an existing event key with the set delay.              |


:::info
**Point to remember**
An action node of a Workflow will not trigger another  Workflow. For example: 
- Workflow 1: This workflow is triggered when a chat is created. Its action updates the chat tag to XYZ.
- Workflow 2: This workflow is designed to trigger when the tag is set to XYZ.
 
In this setup, Workflow 2 does not get triggered by Workflow 1. This is because an action node in Workflow 1 does not automatically trigger Workflow 2. 

:::


#### Supported logic nodes 

You can add **Condition** and **Channel filter** to customize the flow.
For details on the Condition node, refer to the section above.

![image](https://imgur.com/GJ8R5gZ.png)

**Channel filter**: Use this filter to design specific steps for different channels. For example, if you want the flow to perform one action for WhatsApp and another for Facebook, the Channel filter acts as an else-if condition for different channels.

![image](https://imgur.com/8baUuvQ.png)



#### Supported integration nodes 

All enabled integrations in the AI-agent are available for connection. These integrations will be marked as **Connected**. If an integration is not connected, you can select it from the list and connect it through the Extensions.

---------

### Step 5: Test workflows 

To test or debug a workflow, start by reviewing the ticket’s activity to understand where it succeeded or failed. Reviewing logs can help identify any issues, allowing you to open the relevant workflows and make necessary adjustments. Testing workflows beforehand is essential to prevent unexpected errors and ensure a seamless experience for both customers and agents.

Here are two ways to debug/test workflows:



#### 1. Review ticket activity logs

Tickets created and assigned to agents can be found in **Inbox** under **Chats**. You can create a dummy ticket and open two tabs for testing by following [this document](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/inbox/inbox_setup/inboxdemo).

1. Open the ticket you want to test and click on **Activity Logs**.

   ![image](https://imgur.com/jznrJvy.png)

2. Review the activity logs to see the actions taken since the ticket was created.

   ![image](https://imgur.com/qcvAivy.png)

#### 2. Analyze conversation logs (recommended)

In the conversation logs, you can monitor each response by analyzing the logs.

1. Navigate to **Analyze > Conversation Logs > Conversation**.

   ![image](https://imgur.com/nR0ZgfM.png)

2. Click the log icon next to a message to analyze the logs.

   ![image](https://imgur.com/ufALERI.png)

3. Expand the log details to understand the triggers involved, whether they are firing, and the reasons for any failures. For example, if there is a failure in ticket assignment, you can see the cause and the error response, enabling you to take further action.

   ![image](https://imgur.com/J5vjtXI.png)

4. If an action did not respond or is causing an error, you can navigate to that specific node by clicking on **Go to Node**. This will take you to the relevant node in the workflow, allowing you to evaluate and make the necessary changes for improved performance.

## Workflow execution logic


### Sequential execution

- Multiple workflows can exist with the same trigger.
- Multiple workflows with the same trigger and value will be executed in the order they were created (sequentially in a queue like pattern) based on their **Creation date** to avoid race conditions. 

**For example**:     
> At 12:00 p.m. three workflows are triggered, they are executed sequentially based on their creation date, assuming each workflow takes 20 seconds: 
> - Workflow 1 starts at 12:00 PM 
> - Workflow 2 starts at 12:00:20 PM
> - Workflow 3 starts at 12:00:40 PM

### Execution time factors


Workflows are triggered almost immediately when there’s a change in the ticket. 
Each workflow may take a few seconds to minutes (in the worst-case scenario) to complete, depending on its complexity and the number of nodes involved. Execution might be delayed due to these factors: 

- **Number of Workflows for each trigger**: The total execution time increases when there are multiple workflows to be executed by the same event. 
- **Number of Nodes per Workflow**: When there are multiple action/logic/integration nodes or complex branching within a workflow, execution time is increased.


### Data updates during execution

- The system checks the **latest ticket data** before executing each workflow to ensure it meets the current conditions.
- Workflows may be **abandoned** if the ticket data changes while the workflows are in the execution queue. For example, if a chat is marked as Resolved, indicating that the ticket is closed, any workflows dependent on the ticket being open will not be executed.
- Trigger conditions are **re-evaluated** before a workflow begins. If a ticket is updated by an agent or another workflow before execution, the trigger condition may no longer be met. For example, if two workflows share the trigger **Inbox ticket status updated to assigned**:
    - **Workflow 1**: If the ticket contains the “XYZ” tag, resolve it.
    - **Workflow 2**: If the ticket priority is HIGH, assign it to group L3.
    - **Example**: If Workflow 1 resolves the ticket first, Workflow 2 won’t execute since the status is no longer *Assigned*. Similarly, if an agent immediately resolves the ticket, both workflows could be skipped.

> To avoid delays, keep workflows short, as long-running workflows can impact the timing of subsequent workflows. For instance, if using an API node, ensure it has a quick response time to maintain seamless workflow execution.

**Workflows execution example**: 

Consider a scenario where three workflows are queued for execution at 12:00 PM in the following order:

- **Workflow A**: Triggered when a tag is updated.
- **Workflow B**: Triggered when the priority is updated to *High* for escalation.
- **Workflow C**: Triggered when a chat remains unresolved for 30 minutes.

Each workflow takes one minute to execute. Before executing each workflow, the system fetches the latest ticket data to ensure the workflow's conditions are still valid.

- At **12:00 PM**, the system executes Workflow A.
- At **12:01 PM**, the system executes Workflow B.
- By **12:02 PM**, the system checks the condition for Workflow C (whether the chat remains unresolved). If an agent resolves the chat during the two minutes it was in the queue, the condition is no longer valid. The system retrieves the latest ticket data, detects the resolved chat, and drops Workflow C, as its execution condition no longer applies. This dynamic validation ensures the system only runs workflows relevant to the latest ticket updates, preventing unnecessary actions.

## Best practices

### Avoid trigger conflicts

- **Prevent conflicts**: Ensure triggers don’t overlap to avoid unpredictable outcomes.
- **Trigger order matters**: The last trigger activated will determine the outcome when multiple triggers apply.
- **Manage conflicts**: Use nullifying actions or conditions (e.g., add a tag and use it in conditions) to control how triggers interact.

### Avoid Send reply with expected responses

- Don't use **Send Reply** node when expecting user replies, such as in CSAT surveys or queue follow-ups. Use standard conversational flows to handle these interactions instead.

### Consolidate workflows

- **Limit workflow splitting**: Avoid splitting workflows for the same use case or trigger to prevent delays during high load.
- **Combine actions**: For example, handle both handoff messaging and routing to a human agent in the same workflow using conditional branches.

### Ensure workflow uniqueness

- **No identical workflows**: While workflows can share conditions or triggers, each active workflow should have a distinct purpose and configuration. This prevents conflicts and ensures smooth execution across all automated processes.

## Disclaimer

- Workflows are compatible only with bots running on the latest version of our Builder, the cloud executor. If you don't see the workflows section under Automation → Build, your bot may be on an older version. Contact support@yellow.ai to verify and upgrade your bot as needed.
- The time it takes for automations to run depends on the number of workflows, nodes, and tickets being processed in a bot.
- Data referenced in workflows (e.g., Agents, Groups, Tags, Custom Fields) is tied to the environment you're working in—Sandbox, Staging/Development, or Production/Live. 
- When publishing workflows from one environment to another (e.g., Staging to Production), ensure the data referenced (e.g., agents, tags, groups) exists in both environments.  
  - Example: If you assign conversations to "John Snow" in Staging, ensure "John Snow" exists in Production for the workflow to function correctly.
- Date-type custom fields are not supported in the Conditions or Actions nodes within workflows.
- In the **Assign** action node, when selecting variables for a group, only the **Auto-assign** and **Select a variable** options are available for agents, as agents cannot be dynamically filtered based on the group passed through variables.
- Once a workflow is published, it will only apply to active conversations and new conversations started after the publishing timestamp.
- Global variables are not supported in workflows, and the **Trigger Journey** or **Execute Flow** node is unavailable in these workflows.
- In cases of platform-wide disruptions or outages where workflows are paused for an hour or more, we will re-evaluate the conditions before resuming execution. If conditions are no longer valid, the workflow will be discarded; otherwise, execution will continue.
- Tickets or bots that remain idle—where there have been no updates from the customer or agent for over 30 days—are not eligible for workflow execution, and events will not be triggered for these cases to avoid unnecessary processing.
- Ticket-related action nodes, like *Update chat details* and *Assign*, lack fallback mechanisms found in other action nodes. This means that if an action—such as queueing a chat—fails, the workflow will stop immediately or system retries in cases like network errors or temporary Inbox service unavailability (status code 500). Common scenarios where ticket-related actions may fail include:
    - Assigning a ticket to a non-existent agent through a variable.
    - Incomplete configuration of the action node, causing it to enter an error state.
