## Writing AI-agent function code

You can define a custom function using JavaScript. Here is a sample code snippet. Just replace the placeholder 'Your logic goes here' with the specific functionality you wish to implement.

```javascript
return new Promise(resolve => {  
      // Your logic goes here
      resolve();
  }); 
```
---

### How functions work:

This section provides an overview of how functions operate within your AI-agent. 

We will begin with basic examples and gradually move to more complex scenarios, allowing you to build up your knowledge and skills.


In the code examples provided below, you'll see some fundamental JavaScript terms such as `let`, `resolve`, `if/else`, and `console.log`:

- **`let`**: This keyword is used to declare a variable that can hold data.
- **`resolve`**: This function signals the completion of a promise by providing the output from the function.
- **`if/else`**: This construct enables the AI-agent to make decisions based on specified conditions.
- **`console.log`**: This command is used to display messages or data, which is helpful for debugging.


#### 1. Display AI-agent ID (Basic)


Here is a sample code snippet to display the current bot ID:


```javascript
return new Promise(resolve => {
    let botId = data.bot;  // Retrieve the bot ID from the data object
    resolve(`The current bot ID is ${botId}`); // Return a message containing the current bot ID
});
```


 **Explanation:**
 - **Access Bot ID:** The `botId` is extracted from the `data` object.
 - **Display Message:** The function generates a message with the bot ID to be shown as the output.

**Output:** 
The current bot ID is [botId]

---
#### 2. Log current date and time (Intermediate)

The below code snippet captures the current date and time in the Asia/Kolkata time zone. It formats the time accordingly and logs both the date and time. The function then returns the current date.


```javascript
return new Promise(resolve => {
    let currentdate = new Date();
    let currentTime = new Date().toLocaleTimeString('en-IN', { timeZone: 'Asia/Kolkata' });
    console.log("timestamp#########"); // Outputs a marker for timestamp logging.
    console.log(currentdate);   // Logs the value of currentdate.
    console.log(currentTime);  //  // Logs the formatted current time.
    resolve(currentdate); // // Resolves the promise with currentdate, indicating the operation is complete.
});
```


**Explanation:**

- **Get Current Date:** The `currentdate` variable captures the system's current date and time.
- **`let currentTime`**: This declares a variable named `currentTime` using the `let` keyword, allowing it to be reassigned if necessary.
    - **`new Date()`**: This creates a new `Date` object that represents the current date and time.
    - **`.toLocaleTimeString('en-IN', { timeZone: 'Asia/Kolkata' })`**: This method formats the time according to the specified locale and options:
  - **`'en-IN'`**: This indicates the desired locale, in this case, English as used in India.
  - **`{ timeZone: 'Asia/Kolkata' }`**: This option specifies the time zone to be used for formatting, ensuring that the returned time corresponds to Indian Standard Time (IST).
- **Log Information:** The complete date and the formatted time are logged for printing both `currentdate` and `currentTime`  to the console, allowing you to confirm that the correct date and time are being captured and formatted as expected.
- **Return Date:** The function returns the system's current date and time.

**Output:**
Logs the current date and time in 'Asia/Kolkata' timezone and returns the current date.

### 3. Check email verification status (Intermediate)

This function checks whether the user's email address has been verified. It retrieves the user's email verification status and returns an appropriate message.

```javascript
return new Promise(resolve => {
    let emailVerified = data.user.emailOptin; // retrieves the email verification status from the data object.
    
    if (emailVerified) { // Checks if the email is verified.
        resolve("Your email address has been successfully verified."); // if verified, resolves the promise with a success message.
    } else {
        resolve("Your email address is not verified. Please verify your email to continue."); // else, resolves the promise with a failure message.
    }
});
```
**Explanation:**
- **Retrieve Email Verification Status:** The `emailVerified` variable gets the email verification status from the user's properties.
- **Check Verification:** The function checks if the email is marked as verified.
- **Return Message:** Depending on the verification status, it returns a confirmation message or a prompt to verify the email.

**Output:**
A message stating whether the user's email is verified or not, based on their stored email verification status.

## Complex use cases


### 4. Check category match (Advanced)

The following code snippet checks if the text provided by the user matches with any of the categories listed in the data.

It processes the categories and the user text, checks if the text includes the word "and" (replacing it with "&"), and then compares the processed text against each category. It returns "yes" if there is a match and "no" otherwise.


```javascript
return new Promise(resolve => {
  let categories = data.variables.query_result.records[0].main_categories; // Get the list of categories from the AI-agent's data
  let userTextData = data.message; // Capture the user's input message
    
    
  // If the user's input contains 'and', replace it with '&'  
  if (userTextData.includes('and')) { 
    userTextData = userTextData.replace('and', '&');
  }
  console.log("userTextData??", userTextData); // Log the modified user input for debugging
  let cat_arr = categories.split(",");
  const arr_length = cat_arr.length;
    
    
  // Loop through the categories array to find a match with user input
  for (let i = 0; i < arr_length; i++) { /
    if (cat_arr[i].trim().toLowerCase() == userTextData.toLowerCase()) {  // Compare each category (case-insensitive) with the user's input
      return resolve("yes"); // If a match is found, return "yes"
    }
  }
  return resolve("no"); // If no match is found, return "no"
});
```



**Explanation:**

- **Retrieve Categories:** The `categories` variable gets the list of categories from the data.
- **Process User Text:** The `userTextData` is checked for the word "and", which is replaced with "&" if found.
- **Split Categories:** The `categories` string is split into an array of category strings (`cat_arr`).
- **Check for Match:** The function compares the user-provided text with each category in a case-insensitive manner.
- **Return Result:** If a match is found, it resolves with "yes"; otherwise, it resolves with "no".


**Output:**
"yes" or "no" based on whether the user text matches any category.

### 5. Dynamically add authorization token (Advanced)


This function retrieves the authorization token from an API response and prepares it for use in future requests.

It extracts the `auth_token` from the API response, allowing for automated token management without the need for manual entry of the token key.

```javascript
return new Promise(resolve => {
  let { apiResponse } = ymLib.args; // Retrieve API response
  let token = JSON.parse(apiResponse.body); // Parse the response body to extract token

  console.log(token); // Print the token for debugging

  // Return the token in the required format
  return resolve(token.token_type + " " + token.access_token);
});
```
**Explanation:**

- **Retrieve API Response:** The `apiResponse` variable gets the response data from the API call.
- **Parse Response Body:** The response body is parsed using `JSON.parse` to extract the `token_type` and `access_token`.
- **Log Information:** The token is printed to the console for debugging.
- **Return Token:** The function gives back the token in the correct format.

**Output:**
The function will return the extracted authorization token.

### 6. Checking agent or service availability by time zone (Complex)

Here is a sample code snippet to check whether an agent or a service is available based on the current time in a specific time zone (Asia/Kolkata). 

It captures the current time in the Asia/Kolkata time zone and determines if the time falls within the business hours (between 9 AM and 11 PM). Based on this, it either returns "ALLOW" (if within the allowed hours) or "Not ALLOW" (if outside the allowed hours).


```javascript
return new Promise(resolve => {
  let dates = new Date().toLocaleTimeString('en-IN', { timeZone: 'Asia/Kolkata', hour12: false }); // Get the current time in the Asia/Kolkata time zone in 24-hour format
  let status;  
  let hour = dates.split(':')[0]; // Extract the hour from the time string
    
  // Check if the hour is between 9 AM (09:00) and 11 PM (23:00)
  if (hour >= 9 && hour <= 23) {  
    status = "ALLOW"; // Action/service is allowed
  } else {
    status = "Not ALLOW"; // Action/service is not allowed
  }

  return resolve([status]); // Return the status as an array
});
```

**Explanation:**

- **Fetch Current Time:** Retrieves the current hour in the "Asia/Kolkata" timezone using 24-hour format.
- **Check Time Window:** If the time is between 9 AM and 11 PM(business hours), the AI-agent will allow the action or service; otherwise, it will restrict it.
- **Return Status:** Sends a message indicating whether the action/service is allowed or not.

**Output:** 
"ALLOW" or "Not ALLOW" based on the current time.

### 7. Split FAQ response (Complex)

This function splits a FAQ response into two parts and returns them as an array.

It processes the faq_response data, splits it at the $ symbol, and returns the two parts as an array.


```javascript
return new Promise(resolve => {
    let res = data.variables.faq_response; // Get the FAQ response from the input data
    
    // Split the response at the '$' symbol into two parts
    let responses1 = res.split('$')[0];
    let responses2 = res.split('$')[1];

    // Optional: Log the responses for debugging purposes
    console.log("reeeeeee%%%%%%");
    console.log(responses1);
    console.log(responses2);
    
    let responses = [responses1, responses2];  // Combine both parts into an array
    
    resolve(responses); // Return the array of responses
});
```



**Explanation:**

- **Retrieve FAQ Response:** The `res` variable gets the FAQ response from the data.
- **Split Response:** The `res` string is split into two parts using `$` as the delimiter, resulting in `responses1` and `responses2`.
- **Log Information:** Logs the split parts for debugging purposes.
- **Return Responses:** The function returns the two split responses as an array.



**Output:** 

An array containing the two parts of the FAQ response, such as `[responses1, responses2]`.

## Additional options for functions

This section has some funcionalities common to the entire AI-agent that will help you to adjust your AI-agent's performance.

![](https://imgur.com/1hOchRq.png)

#### Tools

This is a global testing and settings tab. It allows you to test your AI-agent's responses by entering user inputs. For example, if you type "speak to support" or "schedule a meeting," it predicts the most relevant intents along with the associated confidence score, helping you understand how effectively your AI-agent can recognize user utterances. Click [here](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/tools#21-test-your-bot) to learn more.

![](https://imgur.com/A8Ia9gx.png)


#### Compare (the function between Staging & Production environment)

This option compares the function between staging and production environments depending on the environment the AI-agent is currently in. 

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/o39MHHR.png)

#### Flows

Flows streamline the management of conversation paths, allowing you to make edits without switching back to the build section. For example, while working on the "Book a Test Drive" flow, you can see relevant nodes like text and carousel. By entering/copying the journey name, you can locate all nodes, modify them in functions, and any updates will be automatically reflected in the flow. This makes managing your AI-agent’s conversations much more efficient.

   ![](https://imgur.com/Cjzmph9.png)

#### Localization

The Localization feature allows you to easily add translation capabilities to your AI-agent. Instead of creating separate workflows for each language, it offers a unified solution. For instance, the phrase "Hi, how are you?" can be translated into various languages, like English, Hindi, and Tamil, ensuring users receive messages in their preferred language. For more details, visit [documentation](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/localization#-12-add-translations-using-code).

## Using functions in flows

Functions are used in flows via the [Function node](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/action-nodes-overview/function-node). 

The following is an example where the function node is used to convert minutes to seconds.

1. Create a flow with the [Question node](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/prompt-node-overview/question-node) to take an input from the user and store the response in a variable, pizzamin.

![](https://i.imgur.com/FS5E7IW.png)

2. Go to **Functions**, pass this variable and write a code to convert minutes to seconds.

For example,

```
return new Promise(resolve => {
    let minutesTaken = data.variables.pizzamin;
    let secondsTaken = minutesTaken * 60;
    let stringSeconds = secondsTaken.toString();
    resolve(stringSeconds);
  });                          
  
```

3. Include a function node, pass the function created in the previous step, and store the response in another variable, pizzasec.

![](https://i.imgur.com/0rC44SF.png)

5. To display the result to the end user, include a [text node](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/message-nodes1/text-node) and choose the pizzasec variable.

![](https://i.imgur.com/lpEw972.png)

**Result:**
