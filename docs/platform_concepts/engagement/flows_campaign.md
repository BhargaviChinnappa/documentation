## Create Flow campaign manually

The campaign flow builder consists of five categories of nodes:

* Entry point
* Condition
* Flow control
* Message 
* Action

:::note
You cannot edit an ongoing Flow campaign directly. You can only pause the current campaign and create a new one from scratch if you want to target a different set of users or segments. Additionally, users who are already in the campaign cannot be removed or stopped.
:::

To create a flow, follow these steps:

1. On the left navigation bar, go to **Engage** > **Flows**.

2. Click on **Create flow** > **Create from scratch**.

   <center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/yplyiKP.png" width="70%"/></center>


5. Define the journey using [Flow control](#flow-control), [Conversations](#message-start-conversation), and [Actions](#action).
6. Set the [campaign goal](#add-goal) as required. The campaign ends when the goal is achieved.
7. Click **Publish**. You will see a pop-up screen asking for confirmation.
8. Click **Publish** again on the pop-up screen.

## Message (Conversations)

This category lets you configure conversations across different channels. You can also configure different actions based on the message delivery status. For example, after sending a WhatsApp notification to announce a new product launch, you can nudge users who have read the notification by sending a discount coupon after 24 hours. Increase user engagement and ROI by sending out different messages when the user reads the message and clicks on the CTA used in the message template.

### Prerequisites

### Map template variables to user or event properties

When using templates that contain variables, you can map those variables to user or event properties, or you can choose a static text replacement for a variable. This gives you control over how you customize your template content.

To map template variables:

1. Click on the specific Map variable option you want to configure.

   <img src="https://i.imgur.com/pWwPkw6.png"/>

2. To map a user property, select **User property** and choose the desired property from the dropdown. For URLs, you can just append the user property to the configured URL.

   <img src="https://i.imgur.com/AwgdgKB.png" width="50%"/>

   <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Pg1iZFA.png" width="50%"/>

4. To map a static text, select **Static text** and enter the text that you want to replace with for the variable.

   <img src="https://i.imgur.com/QpwCHL0.png" width="50%"/>

### Add media content in your template - Static or Dynamic

If your template includes media content, you can customize how this media is sent to users based on the template type. In the "Template Media" section:

In the **Template media** section:

* Select *Dynamic* to send personalized media to each user, and choose the dynamic variable that contains the media file.

   <center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/GEh50DO.png" width="50%"/></center>

    <center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/oAvPu7k.png" width="50%"/></center>



### Define flows based on delivery statuses

This helps you to automate campaign triggers based on the delivery status of your messages to achieve more effective marketing outcomes. You can also have customizable wait times. If users don't take action within the specified period, trigger follow-up actions like reminders. This can maximize engagement and campaign effectiveness.

<center>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/QNZQ4GA.png" width="50%"/></center>


The following table provides the delivery statuses supported for different channels:

<center>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/XW0qyTI.png" width="30%"/></center>

Channel | Supported statuses
---------- | ---------------
WhatsApp/Email/ Google Business Message | Delivered, Not delivered, Read, Replied, and Button clicked.
Push notification | Delivered, Not delivered, Clicked, and Impression.
SMS | Delivered, and Not delivered.
Voice | Answered, Not answered, Busy, and Failed to connect.

The following table provides the different wait time supported:

<center>
 <img src="https://i.imgur.com/NBm6d4w.png" width="30%"/></center>

Wait time | Description
--------- | -----------
Immediately | Select this option to trigger the next action in the flow or launch a campaign instantly without any delay when a specific delivery status is identified. 
Duration | Choose this option to set a custom time duration before triggering the next action or campaign. For example, you can wait for 1 hour, 1 day, or any other specified time frame to allow users to interact with the message before proceeding with the campaign.
Timestamp | Choose this option to set a specific date and time for the next action or campaign to be triggered.


#### Use cases:

Below are some examples that illustrate how to effectively use the feature:

* **Delivery Status: Delivered**:<br/>Use Case: After a promotional message is delivered, wait for 24 hours to see if the message is read by any of the recipients. If the user does not read the message during this time, send a reminder to prompt their attention and increase the chances of interaction.

* **Delivery Status: Read**:<br/>
   Use Case: After a message is read by a user, wait for 24 hours to see if the user interacts with the message using the call-to-action (CTA). If the user does not take any action, even after the 24-hour period, send an automatic reminder to re-engage them with the content and encourage them to respond to the CTA.

* **Delivery Status: Replied**:<br/>
   Use Case: After a user clicks on a button in the message, wait for 12 hours to see if they complete the desired action, such as signing up for an event or making a purchase. If the action is not completed, send a follow-up message with more information or a special discount to entice them to complete the action.

* **Delivery Status: Button Clicked**: <br/>
   Use Case: If a user clicks on a survey link but does not complete the survey, wait for 48 hours to see if they return to complete it. If no response is received, send a gentle reminder with a shortened survey or an incentive to increase survey completion rates.




*** 

## Action

This section helps you configure other actions in the campaign's flow, such as adding users to segments and making API calls.

### API call

Use this to call any internal or external API in between flows. For more information about APIs, see [here](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/api/add-api).

### Update user property

During Flow campaign interactions, you can update user properties. This includes user details such as subscription status, preferences, or gather other relevant information. This enables you to create highly personalized experiences for each user, enhancing user engagement and enriching your user data for better insights and decision-making.

:::note

You can only update custom user properties and the tags property. However, modifying standard user properties, which are available by default, is restricted to avoid any unintended changes that might impact the user experience in a Flow campaign. 
:::

To update a user property in a flow campaign:

1. In **Action**, select **Update user property** and drag it to the desired position in the flow.

  <center> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/FUujXCR.png" width="70%"/></center>

2. In **Property name**, choose the custom property that you want to update.
3. In **New value**, enter a new value that you want to assign to the selected property.
4. For a **Date** property, you will see two options:

   * Select **Real-time value** to set the date when the user reaches the step in the Flow campaign.
   * Select **Custom** to set a static date of your preference.
 
 <center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/YxsLQAe.png" width="60%"/></center>

***

## Add goal

A goal is an activity that a user performs after receiving the campaign message. You can also set the objective of a flow campaign. Once a user achieves a goal, the flow automatically exits the user from the campaign.

For example:
Product promotion: 

1. **E-commerce Campaign:**
   - **Description:** Promote new products via messaging.
   - **Goal:** Track clicks on product links.

2. **Event Registration Campaign:**
   - **Description:** Encourage event sign-ups.
   - **Goal:** Track clicks on "Register Now" button.

To add a goal:

1. In the campaign flow builder, click **Add new goal to flow**.

   <center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/jp1Clr2.png" width="40%"/></center>

2. In **Name**, enter a name for the goal.
3. In **Event**, choose the event that you want to associate with the goal. See [how to add events](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/events/event-hub#-8-custom-event).
4. In **Goal validity**, set the validity of the goal using any of the following:

   i. Choose *Duration* to set the validity of the goal in Hours, Days or Weeks and enter your preferred value in the respective text box.
   
   ii. Choose a *Timestamp* to end the validity on a specific date and time. Select your preferred date and time using the calendar box.
