A message template refers to a predefined format or structure of a message that ensures consistency and standardization in different communication channels. It serves as a convenient tool for businesses to create and reuse common messages sent to their customers. 

These templates often consist of variables that can be dynamically populated with personalized information like customer names, order details, or transaction specifics. By leveraging message templates, businesses can streamline their communication processes, save time, and maintain a consistent messaging approach across different communication channels.

When a WhatsApp template is rated as "Active - Low quality," the campaign is paused to preserve the quality rating of associated phone numbers. Pausing durations are as follows: 1st instance - 3 hours, 2nd instance - 6 hours, and the 3rd instance leads to disabling of the campaign. If you wish to edit a paused template, it must be re-approved before it can be used again.
