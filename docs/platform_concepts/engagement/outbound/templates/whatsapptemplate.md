When creating a WhatsApp template, it is important to note that unlike other channel templates, each WhatsApp template requires individual approval. Once created, the template must be submitted for review by Meta. The review process typically takes up to 48 hours. If the template complies with Meta's guidelines, it will be approved. However, if it does not meet the guidelines, it will be rejected.


The following are the different steps involved in a WhatsApp template:

1. Create a WhatsApp and send for approval.
2. Facebook verifies the WhatsApp template and updates the status within 48 hours.
3. Use the approved template in your campaign.

:::







## 3. Call to Actions (CTAs) in WhatsApp template

A WhatsApp template supports two different CTAs - *Visit website* and *Call phone*. You can only add two different CTAs in a template. That is, you cannot use two Visit website or two Call phone in the same template.

![](https://i.imgur.com/Ru8T1Uz.png)

Navigate to the **Button Type** section and select *Call to action*.

![](https://i.imgur.com/OpV6j9P.png)

### Add URL redirect CTA

1. In **Type of action**, choose *Visit website*.
2. In the **Button** text, enter the label name (character limit 20) for the CTA.
3. In the drop-down box, choose the type of URL to be embedded for the CTA - [Static](#static-url) or [Dynamic](#dynamic-url). 
4. In **URL**, enter the URL that you want recipients to redirect upon clicking the button.

There are two types of URLs you can use in a CTA:

#### Static URL 
In this type of CTA, you need to specify the URL that needs to be opened when sending the template for approval. You cannot modify the static URL once it is sent for approval or post approval. 

For easy approval, it is recommended to use the company's domain URL. Example: [https://docs.yellow.ai](https://docs.yellow.ai)

:::note
When URL tracking is enabled, the CTA button type changes from STATIC to DYNAMIC. URL tracking requires a dynamic CTA template.
:::

#### Dynamic URL

In dynamic URL CTA, you can personalize the URL when sending out the notification through the Notification API/Outbound campaign, as explained below.

Simply specify the static URL (excluding the dynamic path) when submitting it for approval. After approval, append the path with a specific variable before sending the notification to the targeted users.

For example: If the URL is `https://exampleshopping.com/checkout/{userId}`


   1. In the template configuration , just mention `https://exampleshopping.com/checkout/`

   2. When configuring campaign, specify the path variable (say `userId`).

   3. When the campaign is sent, the user receives the URL `https://exampleshopping.com/checkout/userId123`

   When the user clicks on CTA sent through notification, it redirects to the
   [Engage documentation](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/engage).

:::note
* You can only append the dynamic variable towards the end.
* You cannot change the parent domain URL dynamically.
:::


### Add make a phone call CTA

1. In **Type of action**, choose *Phone call*.
2. In the **Button** text, enter the label name (character limit 20) for the CTA.
3. In the drop-down box, choose the country of the phone number.
4. In **Phone number**, enter the phone number that you want your recipients to call.


## 4. Add Quick replies in WhatsApp template

WhatsApp template supports three different quick reply actions. You can use the desired action for each button and a maximum of three quick reply buttons are supported. Each button text can have up to 20 characters. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/khDiOw3.png)

The following are the three different quick reply options:

:::note

#### Activation of Quick Reply Event:

* Regardless of the button action chosen ("send as event," "triggerJourney," or "triggerNLP"), activating the quick reply event is mandatory.
This activation step must be completed before proceeding with any other actions.

:::

### Trigger journey

Use this to trigger a specific journey when the user clicks on the button. For example, you can use it to send a promotional notification about store offers and trigger the bot flow through which users can buy products when the user clicks on it.

**Prerequisite**: A journey should be created already for offers and buy products to select from.

Enter the **Button text**, choose the **Action type**,  *Trigger journey*, and select the **Journey name** that you want to trigger.

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/7a6k9Nc.png)



### Trigger NLP 
Use this to trigger the bot conversation as per the utterances trained under intents. For example, use it to send a transactional notification about order cancellation, and provide a talk-to-customer support button to trigger Live Agent flow.

**Prerequisite**: Live agent flow should be trained with the *Talk to customer support* utterance.
  
Enter the **Button text**, choose the **Action type**,  *Trigger NLP*.

  ![](https://i.imgur.com/Ijp1chQ.png)



### Send as Event 
Use this to send all the template data to the bot and use it in custom flows. For example, you can capture the button clicked and the userId in a custom dataset.

:::note
#### Prerequisite to use Send as Event action
If you use the **Send as event** action, you will need to import the corresponding flow from the marketplace. This import is necessary to ensure the smooth functioning of the chosen button action.
:::

Enter the **Button text**, choose the **Action type**,  *Send as event*.

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/ew3RIM0.png)
  

:::note
Use the Delete icon to remove any button.
:::


###  Trigger flow or display messages when clicking on Quick Reply buttons

To enable users to trigger a flow or display messages when Quick Reply buttons are clicked in the WhatsApp template via the quick_reply_event, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Automation** > **Events** > **Engagement** > **quick_reply_event** more options > **Activate**.

  ![](https://i.imgur.com/kL11NKT.png)

2. Go to **Automation** > Click on **Create Flow** > Search for *WhatsApp Template Manager* > Select the template > **Use template**.

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/wje5yTn.jpeg)

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/Bn2t5n8.png)

3. Once the template is imported, open the flow *Template handling*. In this flow, open the start node > Select **quick_reply_event** from the drop-down.
 
   [](https://i.imgur.com/2ECOQxB.png)

4. Once this is done, the user will be redirected to this flow whenever someone clicks on the Quick Reply buttons in the notification template.

5. To manage buttons, go to the flow *Template handling*. After the database node, you will observe a condition node that creates a condition to compare template names. 

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/rJYrbug.png)

   <img src="https://i.imgur.com/i1tUlHb.png" width="60%"/>

6. Change the conditions of the condition node for the button clicked using the variable *button clicked* and enter the expected button value in the condition node (as displayed in the screenshot).
7. Connect a message node or Execute flow node with the condition node in order to either display a message or execute a particular flow.


## 5. Add variables in WhatsApp template

Variables allow you to personalize message content dynamically for each user. You can use variables in the Body or Footer sections of your WhatsApp template to insert user-specific information such as name, order ID, or email. So, when a campaign is sent, each variable will be automatically populated with real user data.



Here’s a professionally written, user manual-style version that integrates the new META guidelines with your original intent, following a structured and polished tone suitable for product documentation:

---

### 5. Add Variables to WhatsApp templates

Variables allow you to personalize message content dynamically for each user. These placeholders can be used in the **Body** or **Footer** sections of your WhatsApp template to insert user-specific information such as name, order ID, or email.


META has updated its template guidelines to enforce **named variables** instead of numeric identifiers. Adhering to these new rules is mandatory to avoid rejections or errors during template submission.

#### ❌ Deprecated format

Using numeric placeholders is no longer supported.
**Invalid Example:**

```text
{{1}}, {{2}}, {{3}}
```

#### ✅ Supported format

All variables must now follow the **named format** with meaningful identifiers.
**Valid Examples:**

```text
{{name}}, {{order_id}}, {{customer_email}}
```


#### Variable naming rules

When defining variables:

* Use double curly brackets: `{{ }}`
      ![](https://i.imgur.com/2DX9Uiu.png)

* Variable names can contain:

  * Lowercase letters (a–z)
  * Numbers (0–9)
  * Underscores (\_)

**Correct Examples:**

* `{{customer_name}}`
* `{{order_id}}`
* `{{email_1}}`


#### Previewing variables in templates

Once added, variables will appear highlighted in the **Preview** tab of the template editor for easy identification. This helps you confirm placement and structure before submitting the template for approval.

Example:
If you define `{{user_name}}`, the preview will highlight this variable in blue to help you visualize how the content will look during live messaging.
   <img src="https://i.imgur.com/jRhm0jE.png" width="50%"/>


:::info
### 📌 Important notes

* Ensure all new templates created on the platform or submitted directly to META follow the updated naming conventions.
* Templates using the deprecated numeric format will be **rejected** by META.
* We recommend adopting descriptive variable names to improve clarity for both reviewers and your internal teams.

## 6. Setup URL clicks tracking in WhatsApp campaigns

URL click tracking in Campaigns allows you to monitor user clicks on links used in messages.  Before sending out the actual message, the URLs in the template are shortened, and each user is provided with a unique identifier. This allows you to track individual clicks on the links, providing valuable insights into user engagement and campaign performance.

You can track URL clicks in three different elements of your template - Template body, CTA, and variable.

:::note
URL click tracking is currently
* supported for SMS and WhatsApp campaigns. If you need it for URLs in other channels, please contact us.
* available only for Premium users.
:::

#### Sample use cases:
1. **E-commerce**: Track how many users clicked on the link to a specific product or offer in your online store.
2. **Surveys**: Measure the response rate by tracking the number of users who clicked on the survey link.
3. **Event invitations**: Monitor the interest level by tracking clicks on event registration links.

To setup URL clicks tracking:
1. Create your marketing campaign with the URLs.
2. Navigate to the **URL click tracking** section and select the URL(s) that you want to track. You will see all the URLs used in the template in the respective sections - this includes URLs in Body text, variables and CTAs.

   <img src="https://i.imgur.com/G1ihjVL.png"/>

3. Send out the campaign to users with the template. The URLs in the tracked list are shortended and a unique identifier is provided to each user before sending.

   <img src="https://i.imgur.com/RZGOF9e.jpg" width="40%"/>


### Track URL clicks in WhatsApp campaigns

To track URL clicks:
1. Go to **Engage** > **Outbound** > Click on the respective **Campaign analytics** icon.
   ![](https://cdn.yellowmessenger.com/assets/yellow-docs/outcamp.png)

2. Scroll down to the bottom of the report.

   <img src="https://cdn.yellowmessenger.com/assets/yellow-docs/templatename.png"/>

   * **Total clicks**: Represents the total number of times the CTA was clicked, including repeated clicks by the same user.
   * **Unique clicks**: Represents the number of distinct users who clicked the CTA. Multiple clicks by the same user are counted only once.


If CTA URL tracking is enabled for a single CTA button, you will see the details of CTA link. If CTA URL tracking is enabled for variable and CTA button, you will see both the metrics as shown below.
   ![](https://cdn.yellowmessenger.com/assets/yellow-docs/CTAlink.png)




## 7. View WhatsApp template approval or rejection status
Once a WhatsApp template is approved and marked as Active, it can be used to send messages to customers, regardless of its quality rating. However, WhatsApp templates are rated based on their quality, reflecting their performance. 

Users can report or block WhatsApp templates which can result in blocking of the campaign. If the template receives consistent negative feedback, its status may change and can interrupt the campaign, impacting its performance. 

By actively monitoring the approval status, you can proactively address any potential issues and maintain seamless communication with your audience.

   <img src="https://i.imgur.com/gUS1F5W.png"/>

The following are the different statuses available for an Active template:

Column Name | Description
------------- | ----------
Template name | Name of the template.
Status | The current status of the template.<ul><li>**Pending**: Templates that have been submitted for approval but are still awaiting review from Facebook.</li> <li>**Rejected**: Templates that have been reviewed and rejected for not meeting the guidelines or requirements set by WhatsApp. These templates cannot be used for messaging purposes.</li> <li>**Disabled**: Templates that were previously approved but have been disabled either by the business or by WhatsApp. Disabled templates cannot be used for messaging until reactivated.</li> <li>**Approved**: Templates that have successfully passed the review process and meet the guidelines and requirements set by WhatsApp. These templates are eligible for use in messaging campaigns.</li> <li>**1st pause**: Templates that have successfully passed the review process but received negative feedback from users. The campaign using these templates will be suspended for 3 hours as a precautionary measure.</li> <li> **2nd pause**: If you resend the same template after the 3-hour suspension, the templates will be blocked for 6 hours as a further measure to prevent any potential issues or misuse.</li></ul>
Quality | The quality rating of the template based on users feedback.<ul><li>**Not available**: This is the initial rating for approved message templates.</li><li>**High**: Templates with positive performance and user feedback.</li><li>**Medium**: Templates with moderate performance and user feedback.</li><li>**Low**: Templates with poor performance and negative feedback.</li></ul>
Template category | Classification of the template based on its purpose or content - Utility, Marketing.<ul><li>**Utility templates** for WhatsApp are used for transactional or service-based messages. You can use this to provide important updates or assist users with specific tasks.</li><li>**Marketing templates** for WhatsApp are used for promotional purposes to engage with customers and drive business growth. These messages usually focus on campaigns, offers, or recommendations.</li></ul>
Created on | Date and time of the template creation. 
Created by | The platform user who the template.
  
:::note
When a WhatsApp template is rated as "Active - Low quality," the campaign is paused to preserve the quality rating of associated phone numbers. Pausing durations are as follows: 1st instance - 3 hours, 2nd instance - 6 hours, and the 3rd instance leads to disabling of the campaign. If you wish to edit a paused template, it must be re-approved before it can be used again.
:::

:::info
When using [Notification APIs](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/outbound/notification-engine), you may encounter the following error message if the template receives a low rating.

```json
{ 
    success: false, 
    message: "Template:<template-name> has reached low quality and cannot be used"
}
```

## 9. WhatsApp template guidelines

A WhatsApp template needs to be approved by Facebook before you start using it. Here are some standard guidelines that you need to follow while creating a template to avoid rejections.

  

:::note
When you send a template for approval, Facebook approves it only if everything is as per the guidelines. or will reject it if it is not as per their standards.
:::

You can see the template status on the Templates home page.

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/OdfsUpB.jpeg)


Here are some basic guidelines that you can follow to get your templates approved -    

:::note
For a complete list of rejection reasons, see [here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/message-templates/guidelines/).
:::
  

* Spelling or grammatical errors.
* Missing variable parameters or incorrect curly braces. The correct format is {{1}}.
* Undefined variable parameters.
* Non-sequential variable parameters. For example, {{1}}, {{2}}, {{4}}, {{5}} are defined but {{3}} does not exist.
* Mismatch in the defined language and the template content. For example, Spanish was select but the content is English or the content is a mixture of languages containing both Spanish and English.
* The URL domain in your links does not belong to your business.



### Examples of approved & rejected templates

  

1. The template on the **left** got rejected because it placed a link inside the body instead of using call to action. The one on the **right** got approved after removing the link.

   <img src="https://i.imgur.com/mBJxZ7t.png" width="70%"/>

  
2. The template on the **left** got rejected because user didn't pass any parameter inside curly braces. The one on the **right** got approved after passing a parameter inside the bracket.
