:::


1. In the left navigation bar, go to **Engage** > **Templates**.

3. Create the template using the available options. For descriptions, refer to the following table.

   ![](https://cdn.yellowmessenger.com/xUABq9rVRsiP1649260093253.png)

   Option | Description
   -------- | ---------
   Template name | Name the template. Name should be in lower case, and you can only use underscore as a special character. Example: sms_name
   Sender ID | Provide the number from which you want to send the SMS. For example, you can use a numeric ID like 12345 or a custom name such as MYSHOP. For example, this could be a numeric identifier like 9876543210 or a custom alphanumeric ID such as MYSHOP.
   Template ID | Template ID associated with the SMS message. <br/>For Indian numbers, this identifier is mandated by the DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology) platform to comply with local regulations. It is a numeric value with length between 12 and 19 characters. You can find this against the template from the DLT portal of the brand. <br/> However, for numbers in other regions, such as the US, this may not apply. In such cases, you can input any value or leave it blank, depending on the provider's specifications. Requirements may vary across geographies, so it's best to confirm with the Engage/Channels team for region-specific guidelines.
   Language | Choose the language of the message.
   Body text | Enter the message body. To add variables such as verification code, payment links, or first name, use {{ }}. For Example: {{CustName}}<br/>To create a new variable, use the structure {{*variable_name_comes_here*}} - i.e., the variable name between double curly brackets.

:::note
When URL tracking is enabled, the CTA button type changes from STATIC to DYNAMIC. This ensures URL tracking requires a dynamic CTA template.

### 1.1 Setup URL clicks tracking in SMS campaigns

URL click tracking in Campaigns allows you to monitor user clicks on links used in messages.  Before sending out the actual message, the URLs in the template are shortened, and each user is provided with a unique identifier. This allows you to track individual clicks on the links, providing valuable insights into user engagement and campaign performance.

:::note
URL click tracking is currently
* Supported for SMS and WhatsApp campaigns. If you need it for URLs in other channels, please contact us.
* Available only for Premium users.
:::


You can track URL clicks in three different elements of your template - Template body, CTA, and variable.

#### Sample use cases:
1. **E-commerce**: Track how many users clicked on the link to a specific product or offer in your online store.
2. **Surveys**: Measure the response rate by tracking the number of users who clicked on the survey link.
3. **Event invitations**: Monitor the interest level by tracking clicks on event registration links.


To set up URL clicks tracking:
1. Create your marketing campaign with the URLs.
2. Navigate to the **URL click tracking** section and select the URL(s) that you want to track. You will see all the URLs used in the template in the respective sections - this includes URLs in Body text, variables and CTAs.

   <img src="https://i.imgur.com/1W8LlCr.png"/>

3. Click **Create template**.    

4. [Send out the campaign](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/outbound/outbound-campaigns/run-campaign) to users with the template. The URLs in the tracked list are shortened, and a unique identifier is provided to each user before sending.


### 1.2 Track URL clicks in SMS campaigns

To track URL clicks:
1. Go to **Engage** > **Outbound** > Click on the respective **Campaign analytics** icon.
   ![](https://cdn.yellowmessenger.com/assets/yellow-docs/outcamp.png)

2. Scroll down to the bottom of the report.

   <img src="https://cdn.yellowmessenger.com/assets/yellow-docs/templatename.png"/>

   * **Total clicks**: Represents the total number of times the CTA was clicked, including repeated clicks by the same user.
   * **Unique clicks**: Represents the number of distinct users who clicked the CTA. Multiple clicks by the same user are counted only once.


If CTA URL tracking is enabled for a single CTA button, you will see the details of CTA link. If CTA URL tracking is enabled for variable and CTA button, you will see both the metrics as shown below.

Template content will undergo review by the DLT portal to ensure message quality. The template can be approved or rejected which you can check from the DLT portal itself.

DLT account is mandatory for the brands to communicate with the customers with transactional & promotional messages.
