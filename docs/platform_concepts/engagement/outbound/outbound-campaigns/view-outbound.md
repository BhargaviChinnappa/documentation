## Pause or resume campaign

You can temporarily halt or restart a campaign from execution. When you pause a campaign, it stops sending messages and remains in a paused state until you decide to resume it. This can be useful when you need to make adjustments, review performance, or address any issues. Once you're ready, you can easily resume the campaign to continue sending messages to your intended recipients. Pausing and resuming campaigns gives you control and flexibility in managing your messaging activities.

* To pause a campaign, navigate to the desired campaign in the Outbound campaigns table and click on the **Pause** icon.
