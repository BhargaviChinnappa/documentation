title:  Web behavior conditions
sidebar_label: Campaign display conditions
---


When creating an Inbound campaign, you need to define when the campaign should show. You can use various conditions or strategies to run effective inbound campaigns. 

This article provides various conditions (web behavior) that the Inbound campaign supports and helps you with setting up multiple conditions.
  
 
 ## 1. Evaluate multiple conditions
  

For every Condition set, you can have one or more conditions, and for every campaign (Web behavior settings), you can have multiple Condition sets.
  

By default, *and* is applied between each condition within a Condition set and *or* is applied between each Condition set of Web behavior settings. 

Hence, the campaign is displayed only when all the conditions of any Condition set are met.

To know how to define conditions, see the following section

## 2. Trigger events

Option | Description
-------- | ---------
URL | Show the campaign only when visitors are on a particular URL or if the URL includes/excludes a specific keyword. You can use *is/is not*, or *includes/ does not include*. <br/>You can also use  **Wildcard (*)**, an asterisk to mention any keyword in the URL that is not specific. For example, the URL **http://yellow.ai/*/blog** considers any value in the URL in place of *.![](https://i.imgur.com/peathJj.png)
Referrer | The source (URL) from which the visitor has redirected to the current page.
Number of site visits | The number of times a user has visited the specified website site (It considers sessions, not page views).
Device | The device from which the visitor accessed the website - mobile, desktop, or tablet.
Seconds on page | Show the campaign if the visitor has been on the page for a certain number of seconds. 
Scroll percentage | Show the campaign when a visitor scrolls down X percent of the page.
On exit intent | Show the campaign when a visitors's cursor leaves the window on the top half of the screen, usually indicating they intend to change browser tabs or close the current tab or window.
Cookie | Show the campaign either to visitors who have or do not have a specific cookie attached to them. You will have to define the cookies using *key-value* pairs.
CTA | Show the campaign when the visitor clicked on a specific page element. Use the selector and define the *key-value* pair.
Element hovered over | Show the campaign when the vision hovered on a specific element of the page. Use the selector and define the *key-value* pair.

```
document.getElementById('ymIframe').contentWindow.postMessage(JSON.stringify({
   event_code: 'ym-inbound-event',
   data: JSON.stringify({
      >event: { 
         code: "eventName”
         }
      })
   }))`

```

## 3. Web behavior triggers for content marketing

This section explains how you can configure the condition for different web pages such as Home, Solutions, Product details, Blog, and Pricing pages.

:::note
You can just use this for reference and there could be many other pages and use cases that were not covered in this section.
:::

### 3.1 Homepage

#### 1. Homepage help
Brands do not want visitors to spend too much time on the homepage. Instead, they prefer quickly moving to the next stage in the funnel (example: solutions page, blogs or pricing page). 

Use **URL targeting**, **Seconds on page**, **Seconds of inactivity** and **Scroll %** triggers to identify visitors who are stuck on the homepage, and use Inbound Campaigns to help them move to the next stage.

#### 2. Homepage Ad Banner

Visitors often land on to your website through an external campaign or referrer. Such visitors have a very specific intent. 

You can identify the source from which they have come from using **URL Query Param** and **Referrer** targeting rules to create personalized engagements.
