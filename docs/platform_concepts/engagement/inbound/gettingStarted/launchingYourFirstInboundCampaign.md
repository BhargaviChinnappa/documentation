## 4. Prioritize campaign


When multiple campaigns were triggering at the same instant, you can prioritize which campaign to run. Campaign prioritization ensures that no two campaigns are triggered at the same time.

By default, the first campaign that you create will have the highest priority and the new campaign will have the least priority. You can change the priority of a campaign as per your preference so that the highest priority campaign when there are multiple campaigns at the same instant.

To change the priority of a campaign - 
  
* On the Inbound home page, click on the Priority drop-down and choose your preferred priority. 1 will have the highest priority and the highest number will have the least priority.

You can see the campaigns will get rearranged based on the newly assigned priorities.

#### Supported Button types

1. Trigger a Journey
2. Redirect to WhatsApp Chat



### 6.3 Chat auto-popup

Unlike the preceding two overlay widgets, this one is a part of the chat widget itself that sits at the bottom right of your website.

Whenever this type of campaign is executed, the chat widget opens up with the pre-configured journey, as can be seen in the following image.


![Image.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/a59774be-e9f6-fe9e-e9df-69fe0168e698/doc/068BB776-1320-44EE-951A-D501BCFBC578/B6BD397D-3D20-43E2-BD0A-96EB4244752B_2/GkYg3GybLbn2xnt3mxlrXz6REIdInCLIZvK6nn7p7t0z/Image.png)

  
When an inbound campaign is executed, a pop-up message is displayed on a mobile device. If there is more than one message and other components such as Quick Replies, Multi-select and so on, then a notification message is displayed. Upon clicking the message in the pop-up, the bot will open and display the respective message configured in the inbound campaign. 

:::note
On desktop, bot will fully open when a respective journey is triggered.
:::

Following are the behavior of the pop-up messages on the mobile device when a campaign is executed: 

Message type | Behavior
-------------|----------
Single text message | Displays a text message in the pop-up.
Single text message + any other component | Displays **New message received**. 
Component + no text message | Displays **New message received**. 
Multiple texts | Displays first text message
Multiple texts + any other component (irrespective of order) | Displays first text message
Multiple other components (no text) | Displays **New message received**.
