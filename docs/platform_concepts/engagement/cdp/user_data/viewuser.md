User 360 lets you view the complete details of a user including user properties, tags, user events, and segments. You can use the Filter option to fetch users based on a certain condition, especially when the user base is large.

## Filter users

To see details of an existing user, follow these steps:

1. On the User 360 home page, navigate to the user whose details you want to see.
2. If the user list is long, use **Filters** to show a specific set of records from the entire user base.
3. In **Conditions**, define the condition by which you want to filter users.

You can see three boxes that correspond to `{parameter}{operator}{value}`.

* **Parameter**: The user property that you want to use to filter records (first box).
* **Operator**: The condition that you want to define. It contains `Is known`, `Is not known`, `Is`, `Isn't`, `Contains`, and `Does not contain`. These values might differ based on the parameter selected.
* **Value**: The value of the expression. This might not apply to all operators. For example, firstName Is Tom, phone is known, and emailOptin is true.
3. Use **+** to evaluate `or` conditions. For example, the condition `firstname is tom` + `sam` fetches users whose first name is either Tom or Sam.

4. Use **+ Add condition** to evaluate multiple conditions (`and`). For example, the condition `gender is Male` and `phoneNumber is known` fetches all male users whose phone number is available in User 360, `emailOptIn is false` fetches all users who have opted out from emails.
