You can sync user data directly from third party integration, including Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) and other compatible platforms. You can leverage seamless integration options to simplify and streamline the process of keeping your user data up-to-date within Yellow.ai.

It only supports CSV files, and the filename must begin with `userdata_`. The maximum file size is 200MB.

1. [Connect your integration account to Yellow.ai](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/appConfiguration/overview).
2. Go to **User 360** and click **Import users** > **Sync integration data**.
