## User properties overview

Properties are individual fields to be captured for a customer. For example, name, phone number, gender, email address and more. There are several predefined fields that you can use to capture a user's data. You can also create custom properties if required.

A customer is identified with a unique identifier `userId`. This can be any unique identifier such as mobile number, email adress, or any other identifier. However, you can set only one property for the `userId` for your org.

## Types of user data

There are two types of user data that is supported in User 360:


1. User propertiess

   i. [System user properties](#system-user-properties): Default data that you can capture about your users.

   ii. [Custom user properties](#custom-user-properties): Custom data that you can capture about your users and send to the platform.

   :::note
   You can have up to 300 user properties in User 360.
   :::

2. User Events: Track specific actions or activities performed by users within a system, application, or platform. For more details, see [User 360 events](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/events/event-hub#7-user-360-events-system-events) and [Custom events](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/events/event-hub#-8-custom-events)

  



### System user properties

System properties are the default user properties that contain the essential data organizations need to capture from their users. If you need to capture additional information, you can [create custom user properties](#custom-user-properties).

  
The following are the available system user properties, you can see these in User 360.

## Different user properties


### `UserId` as a property


The `userId` is a unique property in the users schema and serves as an identifier for each user. It helps in recognizing users across multiple touch-points, capture and update user data. A `userId` can be any unique identifier such as phone number, email address, or any other external unique identifier such as driving licence number.

## `Tag` as user property

A tag is a label used to categorise users based on certain characteristics or attributes. These labels can be used to segment customers into different groups for targeted marketing, sales, or customer service efforts. Some examples of customer labels include High-value, New customer, Inactive, or campaign responders.

A user can have more than one tag.

Custom user properties refer to additional fields that you can create to capture information that is not covered by the default system properties. You can define these custom properties according to your business specific needs and requirements.

For instance, you might want to store details such as the number of times they have visited your pricing page, their department, and their preferred product.

4. Click **Save**. This action will save your preference and reloads the table to display your new preference.


### Mark columns searchable

You can select which columns in User360 are searchable. When you enable searchability for a column, you can filter by that property. This also applies when creating segments. Note that system properties are always searchable by default and cannot be deselected. 


To modify searchable columns:


1. Navigate to the **Searchable properties**, section and select the properties you want to make searchable. System properties are searchable by default and cannot be deselected.
2. Click **Save**.

The column you marked as searchable will appear in the Filters for both users and segments.
