The new module User 360 has been introduced recently. It is enabled for all bots created after June 1, 2022.   


The old Users Module is being replaced with the new [User 360](/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/cdp/overview).

 
****

  

This document guides you how to migrate data from the older Users module to User 360.

  

* Old bots that has 0 records in their users module, will automatically see the new User 360 module and will require no data migration.

* Old bots that have records in the Users module, will see a Data Migration window.

:::note
 Data migration window will be open until 10 Oct, 2022. You will lose the old data post that.
