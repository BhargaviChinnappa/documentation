## 1. Introduction

Event-Triggered workflows enable you to trigger personalized campaigns based on user actions.  These workflow campaigns enable reaching out to your users on multiple channels at the right time, in the right context.

#### Use cases
The following are some examples of where you can use Event-Triggered workflows: 
* **Reducing cart abandonment** - Send reminders to complete the purchase to users who have added items to their cart and didn't proceed with the purchase.
* **Welcome mail to new users** - Welcome your new users after they have successfully signed up.
* **Driving up LTV** - Engaging loyal customers at critical moments to drive sales.


## 2. Create an Event-Triggered workflow campaign

### Step 1: **Add an event**:
To create a custom user event, follow these steps:
1. In Automation, go to the **Event** tab and click **Custom events** > **+Add event**.
2. In **Event name**, name the event.
3. In **Event description**, enter a brief description about the event.

</center>

3. Click **Create event**.
4. Push the custom event data of a user using the [Push user event](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/17583548/UVsEVUsg#00eb59cf-7f00-461e-8d53-94eafb056a9a) API. It needs the `userId` of the registered user. Events help you track user actions or trigger a Journey or Campaign for that user.

   If the `userId` does not exist on [yellow.ai](http://yellow.ai/)'s User360 module, you need to call the [User create API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/17583548/UVsEVUsg#e7271fa6-4122-4e0b-a535-fe0354462c35) and then [push the event](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/17583548/UVsEVUsg#00eb59cf-7f00-461e-8d53-94eafb056a9a) data.

   You can use a phone number or email address as a UserID and needs to be unique. For more details, see [userId](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/cdp/user_data/user_properties#1-userid-as-a-property).

### Step 2: Create Workflow

Workflow campaign is like a flow which you can trigger from the Engage Module. 

To create a Workflow campaign, follow these steps - 

1. Create a new flow to use in your Workflow campaign.

   From **Automation** > **Create flow**. [OR]

2. Set to trigger the flow when the event occurs.

3. To the Start node add a new **Action** node, **Outbound notification**. There is no need to configure the start node for workflows.

4. Map **To** to a CDP attribute of the notification type (for example, phone for WhatsApp, email for Email).
5. Use various *Action* nodes in between flows to fetch notification status; use the Delay node to add timeout.

6. Map Template parameters properly with CDP Attribute or AI-agent variable so that the Template can be sent to the user.

:::note
* There should be at least 1–2 minutes delay between an Outbound Node and Notification Status Node.
* It is recommended to have at least 2–3 channels configured in an AI-agent for Workflow Campaigns to have better fallbacks.
* Currently, not all the Action Nodes are supported in a Workflow. Basic functionalities such as Outbound Nodes, Delay Nodes, and DB Updates are compatible with Workflow Campaign.

### Step 3: Schedule an event-triggered workflow

1. Once the flow configuration is completed, go to the **Engage** module > **Journeys**.

6. Select your preferred target audience (segment). Make sure to add your users' CDP records to use for any type of campaign. Know more about [User 360](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/cdp/overview).
