### Challenges in Customer Support

#### Challenge with Traditional support

A single poor support experience can be costly—96% of customers report leaving a brand because of it. Traditional models often create these negative experiences due to three persistent challenges:
* **Long wait times**: Customers expect instant answers, but human teams have schedules. This leads to frustrating delays and missed opportunities, especially outside of business hours.
* **Inconsistent answers**: The quality of support can vary from one user to another, resulting in unreliable information and a fragmented customer experience.
* **High operational costs**: Scaling a human support team is expensive. As your business grows, hiring and training more agents leads to rapidly increasing costs that can limit your growth.

#### Yellow.ai solution: AI-Powered & Scalable

Our AI agents are designed to solve these exact challenges, creating a support experience that is instant, consistent, and infinitely scalable.

* **24/7 Instant resolutions**: AI agents work around the clock, eliminating wait times by providing immediate answers to the majority of queries, day or night.
* **Consistent & Accurate responses**: Powered by your own knowledge base, our agents deliver a single source of truth. Every answer is accurate, on-brand, and reliable for every customer.
* **Efficient Scaling**: By automating routine inquiries, AI agents handle most of your support volume. This allows you to scale your operations and grow your business without the linear increase in headcount and operational costs.

### The Three Pillars of Yellow.ai: Automate, Assist, Analyze

At Yellow.ai, our platform is built on a simple yet powerful architecture: a continuous improvement cycle designed to make your AI agents smarter with every customer interaction. This is achieved through three core pillars— **Automate**, **Assist**, and **Analyze**. They work together as a flywheel, where data from one pillar powers the intelligence of the others, ensuring your automation grows more effective over time.

Whether your goal is to build powerful workflows, strengthen your support teams, or analyze performance, these pillars work together to provide a seamless, end-to-end conversational AI solution.

#### 1. **Automate**

The Automate pillar is where you build, test, and deploy your Dynamic AI Agents. It provides a prompt-based environment to design engaging conversations and a powerful knowledge framework to ensure your agents deliver accurate, context-aware answers across all channels.

**Here is what you will use under Automate:**

* **[AI Agent Builder](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/AIAgent/aiagent_intro)**: Design sophisticated, multi-turn conversations and workflows using a visual, drag-and-drop interface. [Learn more](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/AIAgent/aiagent_intro)
* **[Knowledge Base](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/kb/overview)**: Ingest your documents, websites, and internal knowledge sources, allowing our Agentic RAG to provide precise answers from your own data.
* **[AI Co-pilot](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/AICopilot/copilot) & [Automated testing](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/AIAgent/automated-agent-testing)**: Debug your AI agents in real-time with smart suggestions, and run automated test suites to ensure accuracy and performance before going live.


#### 2. **Assist**

When conversations require human expertise, the Assist pillar equips your support team with AI-powered tools to resolve issues more quickly and effectively. The goal is to create a seamless collaboration between your AI agents and human experts.

**Here is what supports you in Assist:**

* **[Agent Assist](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/inbox/inbox_setup/agentassistbot)**: Empower your human agents with AI-suggested responses, summaries, and actions while they chat with users in real-time.
* **[User 360](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/cdp/overview)**: Provide agents with a complete view of the customer's history and context, delivered seamlessly from the AI agent.
* **[Human Helpdesk Escalation](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/inbox)**: Transfer chats from AI to human agents with full conversational history, ensuring a smooth and context-aware handoff.

#### 3. **Analyze**

You can't improve what you don't measure. The Analyze pillar is a powerful analytics suite that provides deep insights into every conversation. It helps you understand performance, identify patterns, and spot opportunities for improvement.

**Here’s how you gain visibility with Analyze:**

* **[Quantitative Analytics](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/growth/dataexplorer/intro)**: Track key metrics like resolution time, customer satisfaction (CSAT), automation rates, and goal completion in real-time.
* **[Qualitative Insights](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/analyze/analyseintro)**: Go beyond numbers to understand why conversations succeed or fail, based on actual user interactions and sentiment analysis.
* **[Custom Dashboards](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/growth/Dashboards/custom_dashboards)**: Build and share dashboards that focus on the KPIs that matter most to your team and business goals.
