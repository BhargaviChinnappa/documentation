sidebar_label: SSO with OAuth & SAML
---

## Overview

### OAuth 

OAuth is an authentication protocol which supports Single Sign-On (SSO) that streamline user access across various applications within an organization. SSO with OAuth enables your users to access the yellow.ai platform using their existing application login credentials, eliminating the need to re-enter them. It enhances security by enabling secure third-party access to user data without exposing login details, providing a seamless and efficient authentication process. Benefits of signing in through **OAuth**:
*  Eliminates the need for direct sharing of login credentials, enhancing security.
* You can control and limit third-party access to your data.
* Proves adaptable to various scenarios in large-scale systems.

### SAML 

SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) is an open standard for enabling single sign-on (SSO) across applications and services. It allows users to authenticate once with an Identity Provider (IDP) and gain access to multiple service providers without the need for repeated logins. This improves user experience and enhances security in Yellow.ai platform by centralizing authentication. Benefits of **SAML** Authentication:
* Reduces the risk of phishing attacks and password vulnerabilities by eliminating the need for multiple passwords.
* Enables users to log in once and access multiple applications without interruption.
* Simplifies and centralizes user management by delegating authentication to a trusted IDP.

| **Authorization server** | The server issuing the access token, in this case, your application.                                           |
| **Resource server**   | The application that accepts the access token and must verify its validity.     |
| **Redirect URI**      | This URL is where the Authorization Server sends the user back after granting permission to the Yellow.ai client.|
| **Response type**     | The type of information the Client (Yellow.ai) expects to receive. For this case, the Response Type will be "code" indicating an Authorization Code. |
| **Grant type**        | Refers to the way an OAuth application gets the access token. In this case, the authorization code flow will be used. |
| **Scope**             | Granular permissions the Client (Yellow.ai) wants, such as access to data or to perform actions. For this case, openid, profile, and email are required scopes. |
| **Consent**           | The Authorization Server verifies with the Resource Owner (user) whether they want to give the Client (Yellow.ai) permission. |
| **Client ID**         | This ID is used to identify the Client (Yellow.ai) with the Authorization Server. Provided by Authorization Server to Client (Yellow.ai). |
| **Client secret**     | A secret password known only to the Client (Yellow.ai) and Authorization Server, allowing secure information sharing. Provided by Authorization Server to Client (Yellow.ai). |
| **Authorization code**| A short-lived temporary code the Client (Yellow.ai) gives the Authorization Server in exchange for an Access Token (valid for one-time use with a maximum lifetime of 10 minutes). |
| **Access token**      | The key used by the Client (Yellow.ai) to communicate with the Resource Server. Similar to a badge or key card, it grants permission to request data or perform actions with the Resource Server on behalf of the Client (Yellow.ai). |
| **OAuth application** | The entity created by the Authorization Server containing details (such as Client ID, Client Secret, Redirect URL, etc.) corresponding to a specific OAuth client. |

## Configure OAuth sign-in 

To configure OAuth, follow the steps below:

### Step 1: Set Up OAuth in IDP

Ensure the your Identity Provider (IDP) supports OAuth. 

Configure OAuth settings in the client's IDP:
1. Create a new OAuth client application.
2. Whitelist the following redirect URLs on your IDP's OAuth app:
    - ```https://cloud.yellow.ai/api/sso/oauth/handle-redirect```                                               
    - ```https://app.yellow.ai/api/sso/oauth/handle-redirect```                                   
3. Obtain client ID, client secret or other necesary details (step #2).

Steps to **retrieve details** from a few **common identity providers** are outlined below: 

| Identity provider  | Values required to set up SSO for yellow.ai | Step-by-step guide |
| -------- | -------- |  -------- |
| **Okta**     | Okta domain  <br/>  Client ID  <br/> Client Secret     | [Click here](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-oauth-for-okta/main/#create-an-oauth-2-0-app-in-okta)     |
| **Red Hat** | Realm <br/>  Client ID  | [Click here](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_single_sign-on/7.0/html/server_administration_guide/clients#oidc_clients) |

### Step 2: Share OAuth setup details

Once you have set up your IDP, share the following details (fetched from your identity provider) with our support team at [support@yellow.ai](mailto:support@yellow.ai):

| Field   | Description |
|---------| -----------|
| **Email**       | Your email address associated with the platform.                                                         |
| **API Version**  | The version of the OAuth API being used. Ensures compatibility between the platform and the OAuth service. |
| **Scope**        | The extent of access requested. Specifies resources or actions the application seeks permission to access. |

| **Client ID**    | A unique identifier assigned by the OAuth provider to recognize and authorize the application.            |
| **Tenant ID**    | Identifies the instance or organization within the OAuth provider, relevant for multi-tenant systems.      |
| **Auth URL**     | URL where users are redirected for authentication and authorization.                                       |
| **Token URL**    | URL where the platform obtains the OAuth access token after user authentication.                           |
| **Token scope**  | Defines the level of access the access token has.                                                          |
| **User Info URL**| URL to retrieve additional information about the authenticated user.                                      |
| **Client Secret**| A secret known only to the application and the OAuth provider for authentication during token requests.  |

After verifying your details, SSO will be enabled for your domain by the yellow.ai team. 

### Step 3: Sign-in using OAuth

1. Login to cloud.yellow.ai
2. Enter the domain name configured for OAuth by the Yellow support team. Click on the **Sign with OAuth** button.
    ![image](https://imgur.com/OJSsVu6.png)
3. You will be redirected to the third-party tool, where you can log in using its credentials to log in to the Yellow platform.

## Role-based access through OAuth

Yellow.ai platform supports various user roles, such as developer, agent and admins. You can configure different roles within your OAuth app and assign users to each role as per your requirement. 

To enable role-based access for your OAuth set-up, follow these steps: 

> Prerequisite: Configure OAuth sign-in and fetch your bot ID. 

### Step 1: Add user roles in IDP


Add roles in your respective identity provider app. Following are the **supported user roles** in the yellow.ai platform:

- **Admin** (Bot admin)
- **Agent** (Inbox agent)
- **Developer** (Developer)
- **InsightsUser** (Insights user)
- **EchoAdmin** (Inbox admin)
- **Approver**
- **Tester**
- **Database** (Database viewer)
- **EngagementAdmin** (Engage admin)
- **EngagementUser** (Engage viewer)


:::note
**Super admin** role is automatically created and assigned to the primary email address of the bot when the bot is created. It cannot be assigned through role mapping or the yellow.ai UI.
Learn more about other user roles [here](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/Getting%20Started/add-bot-collaborators#user-roles-and-access). 
:::


**Syntax to add user roles in the identity provider app**: `botId.{role}`
> Example: x1599503999999.admin


**Syntax to provide table and read/write access to database users:**
- **For App and Cloud (legacy tables)**:`botId.database.{tableName}.{accessType}`
- **For Cloud (v2 tables):** `botId.database.{tableName}:v2.{accessType}`


:::info

`accessType`  can have one of the following values:
- `read` for viewing the respective `tableName`. Ex: `x1599503999999.database.feedback.read`, `x1599503999999.database.users.write`
- `write` for performing editing operations on the respective `tableName`. Ex: `x1599503999999.database.users:v2.read`, `x1599503999999.database.feedback:v2.write` 

:::

### Step 2: Assign users to roles in IDP

Once the roles are added to your IDP, you can assign users to each role. Steps to add user roles differ for each identity provider, follow the steps mentioned by the provider itself. For example, [this guide is for Microsoft AzureAD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-add-app-roles-in-azure-ad-apps).

The following video demonstrates how to assign users to a user role in Microsoft AzureAD.

:::note
If your identity provider isn't configured in yellow.ai for SSO, share OAuth details directly with [yellow.ai's support team](mailto:support@yellow.ai).
:::


### Step 3: Share user role details with yellow.ai

Share the following information with the support team at support@yellow.ai:
    
- **OAuth details** if the identity provider is not configured in yellow.ai for SSO.
- **Roles or groups** created in user details (retrievable on yellow platform through the `/userinfo` endpoint). Also, share the **key** associated with passing role values. Refer to the legend below for the correct role attribute based on your identity provider:

| Identity Provider Type | Role Attribute |
| -------- | -------- |
| Azure Active Directory     | Roles     |
|Okta| Groups|
|Auth0|As configured on the identity provider (dynamic value) |
|Ping Identity|As configured on the identity provider (dynamic value)|



#### Testing what user details are retrieved from your OAuth using `/userinfo` endpoint

To know what user details are retrieved by the SSO, make an API request to the GET `/userinfo` API. 

The JSON response includes the following data - `email`, `roleAttribute`, `given_name`, and `roleAttribute`. If a user is assigned to multiple roles across various AI-agents, you will observe the list of role attributes along with their associated bots presented as an array within the `roleAttribute` field, as demonstrated in the following response.


```json
{
  "email": "something@domain.com",
  "family_name": "Steve",
  "given_name": "Smith", 
  "roleAttribute": ["x1597777777777.admin", "x1597777777777.agent", "x1607777777777.admin", "x1607777777777.developer"]
}
```


:::note
Once OAuth role mapping is enabled, the role update UI (s setting > Access control) on the yellow.ai platform will be disabled. Roles can only be updated from the identity provider, and users will be assigned updated roles at the time of login.
