Tokopedia is an e-commerce company in Indonesia that allows businesses to buy and sell various products and services online. Tokopedia allows sellers to create online stores and list their products, while customers can browse and purchase items.

Connecting Tokopedia to Yellow.ai enables the following features:
* **Live agent support**: If the bot is unable to address a user's query or request, it initiates the creation of a support ticket in the Inbox. This enables live agents to step in and provide further assistance.
* **Supported message types**: You can use various message types that can be sent by the users to the bot and live agent, including text and image.

## Setting up Tokopedia chatbot

### Create a developer app

You can create two types of apps:
