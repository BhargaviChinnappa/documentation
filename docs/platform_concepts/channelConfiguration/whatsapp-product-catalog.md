WhatsApp product catalog enables businesses to showcase and sell their products directly within the WhatsApp messaging platform. In catalog, you can provide detailed information about their products, including the product name, description, website link, price, and product code.

Here is a simplified overview of using the WhatsApp catalog:

1. Organize your products into categories to make browsing easier for users.
2. When users inquire about products, share the Catalog link with them.
3. Users can click on the Catalog link to browse through the available products.
4. For each item, users can click on the "Add to Cart" or "+" option to add it to their shopping cart.
5. Users can complete their purchases directly within the chat interface, without having to leave the conversation.

Businesses can share products with users using two interactive message types:

1. **Single Product Messages** (SPM): These messages display a single product item from the business’ inventory in a Product Detail Page (PDP) format.

2. **Multi-Product Messages** (MPM): These messages showcase up to 30 items from the business’ inventory, allowing users to browse through multiple products at once.

## Setup WhatsApp product catalog

To set up a WhatsApp product catalog, you need to create a catalog under each WhatsApp Business Account (WABA). Each catalog is assigned with a unique catalog ID. For detailed instructions, see [Facebook's documentation](https://en-gb.facebook.com/business/help/1275400645914358?id=725943027795860).

### Create a catalog 

To create a Catalog in FBM (Facebook Business Manager) for your business, follow these steps:

1. Log on to [Facebook Business Manager](https://business.facebook.com/settings).

2. Navigate to **Data Sources** > **Catalog**.

3. Click **Add** > **Create a New Catalog**.

   * For the first time you are creating a catalog, click **Get Started**. Select **Create a catalog**, and then click **Get Started** again.
   * If you already have at least one catalog, you will see all of your catalogs listed. Select **+ Add Catalog** to create a new one.

4. Enter the **Catalog name**, select the **Type of catalog**, and click **Create catalog**.

   <img src="https://i.imgur.com/QbxvLO8.png" alt="drawing" width="80%"/>

* This will create a new catalog. Once the Catalog is created, you can add products to the Catalog either manually or through a [Data Feed](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1898524300466211?id=725943027795860).

5. Click **Open in Commerce Manager** at the top right to add and manage your catalog from the Commerce Manager Dashboard.

12. Click **Data sources** to automate the sync based on your preferred cadence such as hourly, daily, and weekly. To find the CSV headers and supported values on the Data Feed, see [here](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/120325381656392?id=725943027795860).

Before using products from the catalog, it is important to consider the following:

* **ContentID**: This ID can be provided by the business or generated automatically by Facebook. It must be unique and will serve as the Product ID in the WhatsApp product message node.
* **Syncing time**: When syncing catalogs using the data feed, it may take some time for products to update. Products cannot be sent on WhatsApp until this process is completed.
* **Mandatory fields for Indian businesses**: For businesses in India, certain fields (origin_country, importer_name, and importer_address) must be filled out according to field specifications before each product can be used as SPM/MPM.
* **Adding field values**: You can add field values (origin_country, importer_name, and importer_address) in the CSV file or use a Data Rule to fill the values by default from the *Data Feed settings* page.

### Link catalog to a WhatsApp business account

Once the catalog is set up, the business has to share the catalog access with the BSP (Yellow.ai) to use items from the catalog in WABA accounts created by Yellow. 

To share catalog access with the BSP and connect it to WABA: 

1. On the client's BM, go to **Catalog** > **Assign Partner**.

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/BCh7ZBZ.png)


2. Enter the BSP's (yellow.ai’s) BM ID(Business Manager) to link to the catalog of the business.

3. Ensure that the BSP's name appears as a partner for the catalog, and enable **Manage catalog** permission.

4. Once the access is shared, the BSP will get the catalog listed at their end, as shown below.

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/XEcYZTy.png)


5. After getting access, the BSP has to link the catalog to the WABA. To do this, the BSP has to go to the **Phone Number** page on the WABA account on BM, click on the **Cart** icon on the left pane, and then choose the Catalog that needs to be linked.

5. [Test the WhatsApp chatbot](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/channelConfiguration/test-wa-bot) to ensure that the catalog items are displayed in the chat interface.

### Compliance to use SPM/MPM on WhatsApp (Mandatory for Indian WABA)

It is mandatory for Indian businesses to provide business and [compliance information](https://www.whatsapp.com/policies/commerce-policy/) to use the SPM/MPM feature on their WABA accounts. This is mandatory for all Indian WhatsApp business accounts.

Log on to the [Cloud Platform](https://cloud.yellow.ai/), go to **Channels** > **WhatsApp**, and fill in all the basic and additional details.

## Best practices to setup a WhatsApp Business Catalog 

You need to consider the following best practices while setting up your WhatsApp product catalog:

* **Categorize products**: Use categories to systematically organize your products. This helps users to browse through the catalog items that they want to buy.
* **Add high-resolution images and product details**: Ensure that your catalog features high-resolution images and product details such as product name, description, product code, pricing, and a direct link to the website to showcase your products.
* **Optimize catalog size**: You can add up to 500 items to their product catalog. It is recommended to include only the best sellers and in demand products.
* **Update products regularly**: Keep each product listing up-to-date with correct pricing, product names, and availability to provide accurate information to build trust with customers.
