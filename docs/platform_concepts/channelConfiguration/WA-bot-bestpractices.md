This document provides details on the best practises and limitations that you need to follow while creating the WhatsApp (WA) bot. For more information on WA limitations, click [here](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/channelConfiguration/whatsapp-channel#limitations-of-whatsapp-channel).

## Create a flow for WhatsApp bot

Before creating a flow for the WhatsApp bot, you need to consider the following points:

* Determine the purpose and scope of the bot (use case) to create a flow for a WhatsApp bot, like what type of questions or requests the bot should handle based on your use case.
* Select the appropriate environment for flow creation. The following are the bot environments:
   * Two environments - Develpoment and Live
   * Three environments - Sandbox, Staging, and Production
* If a flow is configured and published in a specific environment, it will not respond to queries in other environments.
* If your bot has 3 environments such as sandbox, staging, and production, you need to use sandbox bot for building the chatbot or making changes in existing flows. Once you are done with creating the flows, you can publish the bot from the sandbox to staging.
* Include intents for common questions or requests that align with your conversation flow, aiding in proper training of the bot to identify user intent.
* Use WhatsApp nodes such as [WhatsApp quick replies](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/prompt-node-overview/quick-replies), [WhatsApp list](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/prompt-node-overview/whatsapp-list-node), and [prompt carousel](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/prompt-node-overview/carousrel-node) to enhance the flow's functionality.



### Using WhatsApp nodes

#### **Prompt carousel node**

The WA bot will respond with a number list even if the buttons are configured in the quick reply node. In this case, you can use the [prompt carousel](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/prompt-node-overview/carousrel-node) node instead of quick reply to display the buttons in the bot response.

##### **Limitations of prompt carousel**

* Supports a single carousel card.
* Supports a maximum of 3 buttons.
* The maximum number of characters supported is 1024.
* Carousel button - The maximum number of characters supported is 20.

#### **Quick reply node**

##### **Best Practices**

* To know more about how to use the WA quick reply node, click [here](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/prompt-node-overview/quick-replies).
* You can trigger a flow when a user clicks on the quick reply option on WhatsApp. For more information, click [here](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/cookbooks/studio/qr-node).
* To add a quick reply button, you need to switch the channel filter to Website. Eventually, if you try to add a button in the WA channel filter, then the add button option will be disabled.

* If you want to delete a quick reply node, you have to switch to Website from the channels filter and then delete the buttons.

:::note
Using Quick Replies, you cannot add a message with a CTA in WA. It is recommended to use a WhatsApp template and pass the link as a CTA.

##### **Configure Dynamic WA quick reply and Dynamic WA list message**

* For more information on how to create dynamic quick replies, click [here](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/cookbooks/studio/dynamic-quickreplies).

##### **Pass data to quick reply buttons and title using variable**

* You can also pass the data to the quick reply buttons and title using the variable. Use the following code to pass the data:
  
     `{{{variables.info}}}, {{{variables.info1}}}`

For more information on how to create a variable, to store, and retrieve data from variables, click [here](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/bot-variables#31-create-a-variable-via-nodes).

##### **Limitations of Quick reply**

* The WhatsApp quick reply supports a maximum of 3 buttons and 20 characters per button. If more than 3 buttons are added, it defaults to a numbered list.
* If a quick reply button exceeds 20 characters, the message containing that button will not display while the bot is reacting.

#### **WhatsApp list**

* To know more about how to use the WA list node, click [here](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/prompt-node-overview/quick-replies).

### WhatsApp template

A WhatsApp template is a predefined message format that is used to send outbound messages to your users on the WhatsApp messaging platform. It is designed to enable businesses to send structured and consistent messages to your users. For more information on the template and guidelines, click [here](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/outbound/templates/whatsapptemplate).

After creating the template, it must be submitted for Facebook review. Usually, the review process takes up to 48 hours. The template will be accepted if it meets Facebook's rules.

### Quality rating of a WA template

When you are executing a WhatsApp campaign, you need to use a template, and if users block or report the number or template, then the quality rating of the template or the number will reduce. If the quality rating of the number is marked as flagged for more than 7 consecutive days, the messaging limit will be reduced to the immediate lower tier. For example, 100000 to 10000 or 10000 to 1000.

To ensure that the quality rating does not become low, click [here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/messaging-limits/).

1. Login to your Facebook business manager account and select **Account tools > Message templates**.
