## 2. DLT compliance for Indian users

Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is an account which brands need to create by giving relevant business info. The DLT account is in place to prevent customers from being SMS-spammed.


Template content will undergo review by the DLT portal to ensure message quality. The template can be approved or rejected which you can check from the DLT portal itself.

DLT account is mandatory for the brands to communicate with the customers with transactional & promotional messages.

DLT registration can be done via one of the Telecom operators (in no particular order - Jio, Vodafone, Airtel, BSNL, Tata, PingConnect). Yellow.ai does not recommend any DLT vendor here.

Common details that will be expected during the DLT registration are:

1. Business PAN Number
2. GST number (GST certificate)
3. Business Established Certificate
4. Complete Business Address
5. Business Identity proof (PAN Card)
6. GST registration

1. Upload the CSV in the audience

## FAQ

1. Does Service implicit, Service Explicit, Promotional, and Transactional  template support DND (Do Not Disturb) filtering?
* Service implicit: No, this template does not support DND filtering.
* Service explicit: Supports semi-DND. If a user blocks messages from a specific industry, they will not receive messages from that industry. Every 6 months, consent data needs to be uploaded; otherwise, templates may be blocked.
* Promotional: Supports DND filtering.
* Transactional: Does not support DND filtering.
