Instagram is a social networking platform. This integration enables your insta users to seamlessly interact with our bot directly from your Instagram account.

You can also promote your products and services, engage with customers by responding to their comments and queries, and increase your brand’s visibility.

The following are key features of this integration:

* **Automated Replies**: Bot can automate responses to direct messages, comment or private replies, story mentions, story replies, and media share. An [event](#supported-instagram-events) is sent to the bot for each of these actions, such as comments, private replies, story mentions, story replies, and media shares.
* **Supported message types**: You can use various message types including text, image, carousel, and quick replies, enhancing the communication experience.

These features help you engage with your audience on Instagram and provide a more interactive and responsive experience.

  * [Trigger bot flows via events](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/Flows/configureflow#trigger-flow-using-event)
  * [Store user variables that come from user events into DB or User 360](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/cdp/user_data/store_conv_data#store-user-properties-from-bot-conversations) and create personalized conversations using the stored data.
    

   
## Setup your Instagram bot

You need to use intents to identify user utterances and automate respond to their messages on Instagram page.
    
* **Define bot's purpose and scope**: First, understand the scope and purpose of your bot (use case). Clearly outline what types of questions or requests the bot should handle based on your intended use case.
* **[Create Intents](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/train/intents)**: Add the intents that correspond to common questions or requests from users. Within each intent, add the relevant utterances and ensure they are trained to trigger the appropriate flow.
* **[Create flows](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/Flows/journeys)**: Design customized conversation flows to manage responses to your Instram page. You can incorporate text, carousel, and quick replies within the flow.

Once you set up the bot, verify whether the bot responds to user according to the defined use case.   

## Test your Instagram bot

After connecting your bot on Yellow platform, you can test your bot as mentioned here:

1. [Setup your bot](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/get_started/createfirstbot) based on your business use case.

2. Log in to your personal Instagram account or use a secondary test account that you have created for testing purpose.

3. Send a message (as per the configured intent) to the test Instagram account that you have connected to your bot.
    
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/yptWHk5.jpg" alt="drawing" width="30%"/>
     
   
   <br/>• If the intent does not match, the bot should be able to respond with a fallback message.   
    
4. Navigate to the Inbox module on the platform and select **Bot messages** in the **Chats** section. Here, you can view the entire conversation between the bot and user.

     ![](https://i.imgur.com/rAhMS4I.png)
     
5. If a flow is configured for agent reply using the [raise ticket](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/action-nodes-overview/raise-ticket) node to start a conversation with an agent, it initiates a conversation with the agent. Once a conversation is initiated, the user can talk to the agent.

6. To view the entire conversation between the live agent and user, navigate to the **Inbox** module in the platform and select **Bot messages** in the **My Chats** section.
