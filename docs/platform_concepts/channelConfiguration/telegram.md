Telegram is a social networking platform that allows Telegram users to directly interact with our bot through their Telegram accounts. Telegram integration enables two-way conversations, facilitating seamless communication between users and the bot.

Telegram channel integration helps businesses to automate customer support, send campaigns (to send campaigns, a Telegram sender ID is required), collect user feedback, and so on.

This channel enables the following key features: 

* **Automated Replies**: Provides the ability to automatically respond to user messages.
* **Multi-message types support**: You can use various message types including text, image, video, file, and carousel (which can only be used as a CTA), to enhance the communication experience.

## Setup your bot

Set up your bot with the intents to automatically respond to user messages on Telegram.

* **[Create Intents](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/train/intents)**: Add the intents that correspond to common questions or requests from users. Within each intent, add the relevant utterances and ensure they are trained to trigger the appropriate flow.
:::note
To trigger the respective flow in the Telegram chatbot, you must add the utterances `START` and `start` and train them accordingly.
:::
* **[Create flows](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/Flows/journeys)**: Design customized conversation flows to manage responses. You can use the nodes such as Name, Question, Email, Phone number, Quick replies, Carousel, Date, Store comment, File prompt, and Input within the flow.

Once you set up the bot, verify whether the bot responds to user according to the defined use case.

:::note
* If you have not added the `START` and `start` utterances to your flow, the Telegram chatbot will not trigger the intended flow. Instead, a fallback message will be displayed.
* The "START" button is visible only during the initial interaction with the bot.

4. If a flow is configured for agent reply using the [raise ticket](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/action-nodes-overview/raise-ticket) node to start a conversation with an agent, it initiates a conversation with the agent. Once a conversation is initiated, the user can talk to the agent.
