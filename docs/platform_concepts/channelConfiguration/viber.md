:::note
Going forward, Viber will not send 'delivered' and 'seen' callbacks for auto-reply messages. This will reduce the server load by minimizing the number of callbacks that need to be processed. However, Viber will still send one 'Sent' callback when an auto-reply message (default or custom) is sent to a customer. This ensures that businesses can still monitor users trying to engage with them.

## Setup your bot

Set up your bot with the intents to automatically respond to user messages on Viber.

* **Define bot's purpose and scope**: First, understand the scope and purpose of your bot (use case). Clearly outline what types of questions or requests the bot should handle based on your intended use case.
* **[Create Intents](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/train/intents)**: Add the intents that correspond to common questions or requests from users. Within each intent, add the relevant utterances and ensure they are trained to trigger the appropriate flow.
* **[Create flows](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/Flows/journeys)**: Design customized conversation flows to manage responses. You can use the nodes within the flow.

Once you set up the bot, verify whether the bot responds to user according to the defined use case.    

## Test your bot on Viber

After connecting your bot to Viber, you can test your bot by downloading the Viber app on your mobile device from the Playstore.

To test your bot on Viber, follow these steps:

1. Open the Viber app that you have downloaded on your mobile device and search for your bot.

   * You can either scan the QR code from the [Viber chatbot account](https://partners.viber.com/account/) that you have created.

3. Start the conversation to test the chatbot. Ensure that you have created the bot with intents and configured the flows with the same intent.

	 <img src="https://i.imgur.com/YbIFnOv.png" alt="drawing" width="40%"/>

* If the intent does not match, the bot should be able to respond with a fallback message.

4. If a flow is configured for agent reply using the [raise ticket](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/action-nodes-overview/raise-ticket) node to start a conversation with an agent, it initiates a conversation with the agent. Once a conversation is initiated, the user can talk to the agent.

5. To view the entire conversation between the live agent and user, navigate to the **Inbox** module in the platform and select **Bot messages** in the **My Chats** section.

* When the conversation between the agent and user ends, the bot takes the conversation forward with the user.
     
     

## Getting Viber link

Viber links are URLs similar to [deep links](https://developers.viber.com/docs/tools/deep-links/) and are designed to provide a seamless user experience. Clicking these links directs users to specific interactions within the Viber app.

You can get the Viber links manually by appending your chatbot username to the Viber deep link.

To get the Viber links, follow these steps:

1. Open Viber app and navigate to **More** > **Settings**.

4. Embed this link on your business website for user access and interaction.
