```javascript
curl --location 'https://cloud.yellow.ai/api/data/vault/botframeworkTokens?bot=BOT_ID' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'x-api-key: API_KEY' \
--data '{
    "profileId": "PROFILE_NAME",
    "clientId": "CLIENT_ID",
    "clientSecret": "CLIENT_SECRET",
    "tenantId":"TENANT_ID"
}
```
* Verify if the custom properties (teamsConversationId, countryName, jobTitle, officeLocation) are added in your Customer Data Platform (CDP). If any of these properties are missing, manually add them to the [user properties](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/cdp/user_data/user_properties#user-properties-overview).

4. Execute the below curl command, replacing the placeholders with your specific values such as botId, x-api-key, and profileName. Note that 'Profile name' refers to the name configured on the Channel's page during MS Teams setup.

```javascript
curl --location 'https://cloud.yellow.ai/api/integrations-worker/integrationCDPUserSync/bulkUserCreate/botframework/yellow_alpha6?botId=x1632218421575&isChannel=true' \ --header 'x-api-key: 67dYPpyWiGXjppnWMHLJQJB6sWsitkWwg0FjCqQY' \ --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \ --header 'Authorization: Bearer sddd' \ --data '{ "profileName": "yellow_alpha6" }'
```   
   
## Test MS Teams chatbot

To test your bot on MS Teams, follow these steps:

1. Open the MS Teams app on your mobile device or on website.

2. Navigate to Apps and search for the app name under Apps. Select the app that you have created and click **Open**.

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/3dcIEwV.png)

3. Go to **Chats** and start the conversation with the bot. Make sure you have already created an intent and added the utterances to trigger the corresponding flow in your MS Teams chatbot.

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/7JOpALn.png)
     
     
4. If a flow is configured for agent reply using the [raise ticket](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/action-nodes-overview/raise-ticket) node to start a conversation with an agent, it initiates a conversation with the agent. Once a conversation is initiated, the user can talk to the agent.

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/sVnGBQ1.png)
    
5. To view the entire conversation between the live agent and user, navigate to the **Inbox** module in the platform and select **Bot messages** in the **My Chats** section.

    ![](https://i.imgur.com/0AdMWza.png)


   When the conversation between the agent and user ends, the bot takes the conversation forward with the user.
  

## Troubleshooting MS Teams configuration

You can troubleshoot and resolve issues when the bot fails to respond during the configuration of an MS Teams bot in the Teams Developer Portal. This issue often occurs if an incorrect or outdated messaging endpoint is configured in the Teams Developer Portal.

### Steps for Troubleshooting

To troubleshoot and resolve the issue, follow the below steps:

1. Verify message flow
   *  When a user reports that the bot is not responding:
       * Check if messages from Teams are reaching the bot. 
       * If messages are not received, validate the messaging endpoint.
     
2. Get messaging endpoint details

   Get the messaging endpoint currently configured in the Teams Developer Portal from the user.

3. Validate the messaging endpoint

    * Refer to point 8 of the [Set up MS Teams chatbot using Developer portal](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/channelConfiguration/teams#create-a-bot-on-ms-teams) for detailed instructions on identifying the correct endpoint.
    * Ensure the endpoint matches the bot’s configuration region.

4. Verify bot ID and profile ID

   * Ensure that the correct bot ID and profile ID are passed.
   * These values should match the account name configured in the Channels module.

5. Share a valid messaging endpoint

    * If the endpoint is incorrect or outdated, provide the user with the correct endpoint.
    * Guide the user to update the endpoint in the Teams Developer Portal.

In some cases, older bots might have their app endpoint configured instead of the correct messaging endpoint. Follow these steps:

* Use the reference documentation to generate a valid messaging endpoint.
* Share the updated endpoint with the user.
* Assist the user in updating the endpoint in the Teams Developer Portal.
