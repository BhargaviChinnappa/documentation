A chat separator is used to separate the conversations between an agent and a user in a chat widget. This helps you identify when the user is connected or disconnected to a live agent.  

A chat separator is displayed when the following actions are performed:

* When an agent is connected to the bot, a divider is displayed along with the message `"{agent name} has joined the conversation"`. Click [here](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/inbox/inbox_setup/inboxdemo#1-implement-live-chat) for more information on how to connect an agent to the bot.

* When you are closing the ticket/connecting back to the bot, a divider is displayed along with the message "`{agent name} has left the conversation`". Click [here](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/inbox/inbox_setup/inboxdemo#tab-2-live-chat-request-and-resolution-on-the-inbox-chat-screen) for more information on how to close the ticket.
