title: Launch your bot across channels
sidebar_label: Overview
---

Yellow.ai facilitates omnichannel support, enabling you to create and deploy bots across various channels.

When you connect a channel to Yellow.ai platform, it establishes a connection between the bot and the communication app. This connection allows you to engage with your business customers across multiple channels, to improve your business and increase brand visibility.

To deploy your bot on a particular channel, you need to follow channel-specific setup procedures and configurations. Each channel has its own unique requirements, including obtaining authentication keys and conducting testing.

## Understand channel-specific requirements

The following are the points that you need to consider while setting up a channel on the Yellow.ai platform:

1. **Define bot purpose and scope**: Determine the bot's purpose and scope (use case) to create a flow that addresses the types of questions or requests the bot should handle based on your use case. For more detailed information, click [here](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/get_started/createfirstbot).
2. **Choose environment**: Select the appropriate environment for flow creation:
   * Two environments: Development and Live
   * Three environments: Sandbox, Staging, and Production
3. If a flow is configured and published in a specific environment, it will only respond to queries in that environment.
4. **Environment Usage**: If your bot has three environments (sandbox, staging, and production), use the sandbox bot for building the chatbot or making changes to existing flows. Once done, publish the bot from the sandbox to staging.
5. **Add Intents**: Include intents for common questions or requests that align with your conversation flow. This aids in properly training the bot to identify user intent.
6. **Use supported nodes**: Utilize nodes that are supported for the respective channel to ensure seamless integration and functionality.
7. **Channel Switching**: You can switch to another connected channel from within the same flow. The channel filter button is available in the **Automation** > **Build** section.

8. **Regional consideration**: Determine your bot region (for example, r1, r2, r3, r4, r5) and add it to the webhook URL. 
   For instance, if the bot's region is r1, the domain URL will be `https://r1.cloud.yellow.ai`. 
   
:::note
For India region, you can use the original domain itself (`https://cloud.yellow.ai`).
