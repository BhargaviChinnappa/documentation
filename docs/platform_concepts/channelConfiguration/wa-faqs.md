<details><summary><b> Is FB Business account verification mandatory? </b></summary>

Account verification is no longer a mandate for creating your WA business API account and the WhatsApp bot. Though there are some limitations to the same as mentioned, after completing embedded sign-up or "on behalf of" (OBO) onboarding processes, businesses will be able to:

1. Respond to unlimited customer-initiated conversations (24-hour messaging windows).
2. Send business-initiated conversations to 50 unique customers in a rolling 24-hour period.
3. Register for up to two phone numbers.<br/> <b>Note:</b>Â It is suggested to complete the business verification before making your bot live on WhatsApp to ensure unlimited business-initiated conversations after the increase in the daily limit tier.

<summary><b>After business verification on WhatsApp, can we change the website URL? Will there be any impact?</b></summary>

Yes, it is possible to change the website URL after business verification on WhatsApp. However, there may be some potential impacts on the business account that need to be considered.<br/>

Changing the website URL may require re-verification or re-approval from WhatsApp. The new URL will need to meet WhatsApp's guidelines and requirements for business verification.

Post Onboarding:

Businesses can send messages to customers only after a customer initiates a message. These messages are called session messages and can be sent by businesses to customers until 24 hours of the customer sending a message. After 24 hours, the session expires, and businesses can only send "template messages" to their users.
Template messages must be pre-approved by WhatsApp and can be done from the WATI dashboard. All template messages must adhere to WhatsApp Commerce Policies.
- WhatsApp Group Feature is not supported.
- WhatsApp voice or video calls are not supported. Voice notes are supported.
- WhatsApp Message Forwarding Feature is not supported.

Facebook has some guidelines to be followed for display name to be approved. A display name must have consistent branding with external sources(for example, a company's website or marketing).
If they don't feel the display name is abiding all these rules, then they will approve the display name.

- For instance, the Facebook account of the client is in the name of "Tolaram Group" and display name "Colgate" is rejected by Facebook saying there is no link between the two names. So the client has to apply for a new account under the name "Colgate Nigeria."
