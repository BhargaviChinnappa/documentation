Facebook Workplace is an online collaborative tool that helps businesses and organizations to communicate and collaborate with internal team members. Using this tool, you can create various channels that help you to manage work-related activities such as group discussions, project management; file, image, or video sharing, and updates related to specific projects. You can have both public and private channels.

On Facebook Workplace, bots are represented as pages. A page is automatically created for a custom integration app. Only system administrators of a workplace community can create apps and generate access tokens in that community.
