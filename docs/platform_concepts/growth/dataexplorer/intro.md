#### What is Data explorer?

The Data Explorer facilitates the extraction of valuable business insights and empowers data-driven decision making by leveraging the available bot data. This tool serves as a business intelligence platform that enables the creation of custom analytics. By utilizing the Data Explorer, you can conveniently condense data pertaining to specific fields and analyze empirical relationships between fields.

#### Functions of data explorer

Data explorer has several features:

* **Immediate Learning**: Users can start learning from their data immediately.
* **Widget Creation**: Analysts can generate reports and create visually appealing widgets, such as Line charts, Pie charts, and Bar Graphs, without any coding.
* **Standard tables**: The tool provides a standard set of tables that can be utilized to construct Widgets.
* **Custom tables**: Analysts have the ability to create custom tables by utilizing the tables that have been developed by bot builders.
* **Druid Datastore**: Data Explorer currently uses the Druid Datastore and the bot database to conduct its analytics.
* **Dashboard**: Users can visualize the tables and reports generated using Data Explorer through the use of [Dashboards](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/growth/Dashboards/dashboardintro). Multiple dashboards can be created to group widgets based on different use cases.

#### Types of tables available on data explorer

Data explorer is categorized into 2 sections:

* **Default tables**:  These are the tables that are built in on Insights automatically obtained automatically by the bot, they are related to Users Events, Messages, API Events, Agent Events, etc.
* **Custom tables**: These are the custom tables created by the bot builder. A table can be customized based on your preferences. They are fetched using [database nodes](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/action-nodes-overview/database-node)/stored [database](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/database) on the **Automation** page

:::note
The labels Reports and Queries, Datasets, and Tables are used synonymously. Reports/queries are created for the data present in the Datasets/tables. These reports (default and custom) are used for complex data analysis/summarization/visualization.
