## What has happened?
We have revamped the Insights module UI to significantly cut down on legacy features and the black-box nature of our reporting based on valuable customer feedback. In this vein, we have sunset some of our old, out of the box dashboards.

#### Discontinued sections

We have removed the following screens from the UI:

* **Overview** 
* **Metrics**
* **User Journeys**
* **Voice Overview**
* **Doc Cog**

### Why have we done this?

You might have noticed that while these reports were informative and accurate, they acted like black boxes when it came to the underlying raw data. You couldn't perform custom drill-down opertions, change filters, or adjust visualizations for specific metrics. That's why we decided to remove these screens and widgets to make reporting more accessible, transparent, and robust on the Dashboard and Data Explorer pages.

### Where have the old reports gone?
You can check the detailed breakdown [here](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/updates/2024/insightsrevamp#report-migration).

1. All of the discontinued reports have been partially or fully migrated to [Default Dashboards](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/growth/Dashboards/default_dashboard). 
2. Metrics/widgets are moved to default reports labeled as *Created by Yellow.ai*.
3. You can **clone** default reports and dashboards for custom drill-down operations.
4. [Custom dashboards](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/growth/Dashboards/custom_dashboards) and reports are still available on custom tab.

> You will soon be able to setup **Custom alerts** on these reports.

### Where can I find the old exports for Chat transcripts, User traffic, Bot performance, etc.?

Previously, we had standard data exports which could have been downloaded from our out of the box dashboards. We have partially or fully migrated these exports into the Data Explorer in order to give you complete transparency in terms of the availability of raw data and the precise parameters used for metric calculations.

You can find the status of the migration [here](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/updates/2024/insightsrevamp#report-migration).


### Data Explorer and Dashboards - The centre pieces

We've elevated the **Dashboards** and **Data Explorer** features to the heart of the Insights module. All of our reporting has now been consolidated into the **[Default Dashboards](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/growth/Dashboards/default_dashboard)** section of Insights. 

Every report you used to refer to from those screens is available on dashboards labeled '**Created by Yellow.ai**'. 

**Default reports**

[Default reports](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/growth/Dashboards/default_dashboard) are a curated list of Data Explorer powered reports which give you access to the underlying data and parameters, allowing you to tailor them to your analytics needs. They can serve as a starting point for building complex queries or be used out of the box for basic insights. You can clone our [Default Reports](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/growth/Dashboards/default_dashboard) and Dashboards to incorporate custom drill-down operations.

We have curated the following new Dashboards for you:

New Dashboard	| Details
----------- | ------------------------
[Bot Overview](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/growth/Dashboards/default_dashboard)| Replaces the old Overview screen. Contains reports for user traffic and channel consumption.
[Bot performance metrics](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/growth/Dashboards/default_dashboard#bot-performance)| Replaces the old Metrics screen. Contains reports for bot performance and accuracy.
[Generative AI](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/growth/Dashboards/default_dashboard#generative-ai)| New dashboard for GenAI and KB usage.
[Inbox chats](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/growth/Dashboards/default_dashboard#inbox-chats)| New dashboard for Inbox tickets and their statuses.
[Inbox agent performance](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/growth/Dashboards/default_dashboard#inbox-agent-performance)| New dashboard for Inbox agent metrics.
[Email tickets](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/growth/Dashboards/default_dashboard#email-tickets) | New dashboard for email ticket reports.
[Voice](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/growth/Dashboards/default_dashboard#voice)| Replaces the old Voice Overview screen. Contains voice consumption reports.

> We plan to support even more curated reports as we develop new features and expand our data and analytics capabilities.

**Custom reports** 

All reports and dashboards created by you are now available in one place under the **Custom** tab, alongside the Default dashboards curated by us. This makes the Insights module much leaner and easier to navigate.

## Report Migration

This section will give you a detailed breakdown of the extent of changes and help you navigate our dashboards to find all of the old reports and metrics that you were earlier referring to, on our old screens.

### Overview
We've migrated the reports from the Overview screen to the 'User Traffic' and 'Bot Performance' Dashboards. You can find this Dashboard at [Dashboards > User Traffic](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/growth/Dashboards/default_dashboard#user-traffic) or [Dashboards > Bot Performance](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/growth/Dashboards/default_dashboard#bot-performance).

### Metrics
This was a very redundant screen with hardly any differentiation from the Overview Dashboard. We've moved the old reports to the 'User Traffic' and 'Bot Performance' dashboards. You can find these Dashboards at [Dashboards > User Traffic](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/growth/Dashboards/default_dashboard#user-traffic) or [Dashboards > Bot Performance](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/growth/Dashboards/default_dashboard#bot-performance).

## Standard Exports 

Previously, we had a bunch of standard exports which were available on each of the screens which we have sunset. Below is a detailed breakdown of where you can find alternatives to these reports and their migration status.

The ability to [export your data](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/growth/dataexplorer/defaulttables#download-filtered-data-as-a-csv-file) queries will be available for Default and Custom reports. You can also [schedule report](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/growth/dataexplorer/savedreportsactions#1-schedule-a-report) downloads.
