## 2. **Insights**

  

#### 2.1 Enriched channel filter

| *Enhancement*

To understand user behavior in depth, the YellowMessenger channel filter is now divided into:  
1. **Web** - users interacting with bots deployed on websites.
2. **Mobile** - users interacting with the bot via mobile apps.  

Additionally, **Yellow API** is a new channel introduced for users who only use our backend API to deploy bots with their in-house UI.

#### 2.1 Failure reasons in Notifications report

| *Enhancement*


Introduced a new column, **ERRORMESSAGE**, in the Notifications report of **Data Explorer** specifying the reasons behind the failure of notifications delivery. 
There are filters to drill down data that help understand different reasons for notifications failing, retargeting of those users, planning how to avoid such failures in the future, etc.   


#### 2.3 Extended session period (24 hrs)

| *Enhancement*


The definition of a session is now updated to user interaction occurring with the bot within a 24-hours window. A single session is considered for any number of interactions the user has within 24 hours from the start of a session. A new session starts after 24 hours. This ensures better accuracy in the Sessions data and brings consistency across channels (like WhatsApp).   
From a billing point of view, irrespective of the number of messages sent in the last 24 hours time frame, only 1 session will be counted for billing purposes.
