## Introduction

The Integration module in your Agentic AI platform enables the AI Agent to securely connect with enterprise systems such as ITSM, IAM, DEX, and endpoint management tools through API-based integrations.

These integrations allow the AI Agent to perform operational tasks, retrieve contextual data, and trigger automated actions across enterprise environments.

Each integration setup is modular, API-driven, and built to work seamlessly within enterprise ecosystems. For systems requiring endpoint-level operations, clients install a Workplace Self-Service Agent that acts as the execution layer, enabling remote troubleshooting, device management, and action orchestration.
