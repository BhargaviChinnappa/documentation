    title: 'Take Control of Your Data with Retention & Purge',
    shortDescription: 'Manage the full data lifecycle with automated retention policies and one-time purge capabilities to ensure compliance and reduce risk.',
    fullDescription: `The **Data Purge & Retention** feature gives organizations complete control over the data lifecycle, ensuring **compliance**, reducing risk, and improving **system efficiency**.

**Note:** This is a **gated feature**. To enable it for your account, please contact your **Customer Success Manager** or reach out to **Yellow.ai Support**.

### Automated Data Retention (UI Setting)

**Purpose:** Retention is an ongoing, automated process for deleting data on a recurring basis.

**How it works:**
- A **Super Admin** can configure a retention period directly in the admin UI.
- A daily background job automatically deletes records older than the chosen timeframe (30, 60, or 180 days).

**Important:** Once enabled, the retention policy is **permanent** and cannot be changed.

**Best for:** Helping active clients stay compliant with data protection laws without manual intervention.

**Learn more:** <a href="/docs/platform_concepts/settings/general-settings">Data Retention Settings</a>

### One-Time Data Purge (Backend Operation)

**Purpose:** Purge is a one-time, irreversible process to delete data completely.

**How it works:**
- This internal-only process deletes data across **29 system tables**, including inbox logs, video chats, and analytics.

**Warning:**
- The Purge action is **irreversible**, and data **cannot be recovered**.

**Best for:** Fulfilling contractual obligations for **complete data removal** during client offboarding.
